    "description": "Command Injection in Tenda G1 and G3 routers with firmware versions v15.11.0.17(9502)_CN or v15.11.0.16(9024)_CN allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands via a crafted \"action/umountUSBPartition\" request. This occurs because the \"formSetUSBPartitionUmount\" function executes the \"doSystemCmd\" function with untrusted input.",
