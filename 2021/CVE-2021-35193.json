{"id": "CVE-2021-35193", "product": "n/a", "version": "n/a", "vulnerability": ["n/a"], "description": "Patterson Application Service in Patterson Eaglesoft 18 through 21 accepts the same certificate authentication across different customers' installations (that have the same software version). This provides remote access to SQL database credentials. (In the normal use of the product, retrieving those credentials only occurs after a username/password authentication step; however, this authentication step is on the client side, and an attacker can develop their own client that skips this step.)", "poc": {"reference": ["https://github.com/jshafer817/Eaglesoft"], "github": ["No PoCs found on GitHub currently."]}}
