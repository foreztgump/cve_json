A specially crafted MPEG-4 input when decoding the atom associated with the \u201ccsgp\u201d FOURCC can cause an integer overflow due to unchecked arithmetic resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow that causes memory corruption. An attacker can convince a user to open a video to trigger this vulnerability.",
