    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE 330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values"
    ],
    "description": "Randomly-generated alphanumeric strings contain significantly less entropy than expected. The RandomAlphaNumeric and CryptoRandomAlphaNumeric functions always return strings containing at least one digit from 0 to 9. This significantly reduces the amount of entropy in short strings generated by these functions.",
