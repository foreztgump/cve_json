In affected versions this vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to request data from internal resources that are not publicly available only by manipulating the processed input stream with a Java runtime version 14 to 8. No user is affected, who followed the recommendation to setup XStream's security framework with a whitelist limited to the minimal required types. If you rely on XStream's default blacklist of the [Security Framework](https://x-stream.github.io/security.html#framework), you will have to use at least version 1.4.18.", "poc": {"reference": ["https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html", "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2022.html", "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html"], "github": ["https://github.com/ARPSyndicate/cvemon", "https://github.com/Shadow0ps/CVE-2021-28482-Exchange-POC", "https://github.com/zwjjustdoit/Xstream-1.4.17"]}}
