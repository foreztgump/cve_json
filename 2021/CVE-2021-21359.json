{"id": "CVE-2021-21359", "product": "TYPO3.CMS", "version": "n/a", "vulnerability": ["CWE-405 Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)", "CWE-674 Uncontrolled Recursion"], "description": "TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system. In TYPO3 before versions 9.5.25, 10.4.14, 11.1.1 requesting invalid or non-existing resources via HTTP triggers the page error handler which again could retrieve content to be shown as error message from another page. This leads to a scenario in which the application is calling itself recursively - amplifying the impact of the initial attack until the limits of the web server are exceeded. This is fixed in versions 9.5.25, 10.4.14, 11.1.1.", "poc": {"reference": ["No PoCs from references."], "github": ["https://github.com/ARPSyndicate/cvemon"]}}
