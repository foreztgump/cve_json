{"id": "CVE-2021-21844", "product": "GPAC", "version": "n/a", "vulnerability": ["CWE-680: Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow"], "description": "Multiple exploitable integer overflow vulnerabilities exist within the MPEG-4 decoding functionality of the GPAC Project on Advanced Content library v1.0.1. A specially crafted MPEG-4 input when encountering an atom using the \u201cstco\u201d FOURCC code, can cause an integer overflow due to unchecked arithmetic resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow that causes memory corruption. An attacker can convince a user to open a video to trigger this vulnerability.", "poc": {"reference": ["https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2021-1297", "https://www.talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2021-1297"], "github": ["https://github.com/ARPSyndicate/cvemon"]}}
