    "vulnerability": [
        "Arbitrary Command Injection"
    ],
    "description": "This affects all versions of package port-killer. If (attacker-controlled) user input is given, it is possible for an attacker to execute arbitrary commands. This is due to use of the child_process exec function without input sanitization. Running this PoC will cause the command touch success to be executed, leading to the creation of a file called success.",
