{"id": "CVE-2021-24252", "product": "Event Banner", "version": "1.3<= 1.3 ", "vulnerability": ["CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type"], "description": "The Event Banner WordPress plugin through 1.3 does not verify the uploaded image file, allowing admin accounts to upload arbitrary files, such as .exe, .php, or others executable, leading to RCE. Due to the lack of CSRF check, the issue can also be used via such vector to achieve the same result, or via a LFI as authorisation checks are missing (but would require WP to be loaded)", "poc": {"reference": ["No PoCs from references."], "github": ["https://github.com/jinhuang1102/CVE-ID-Reports"]}}
