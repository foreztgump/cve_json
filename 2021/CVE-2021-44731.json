{"id": "CVE-2021-44731", "product": "snapd", "version": "<= 2.54.2 ", "vulnerability": ["CWE-362 Race Condition (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization)"], "description": "A race condition existed in the snapd 2.54.2 snap-confine binary when preparing a private mount namespace for a snap. This could allow a local attacker to gain root privileges by bind-mounting their own contents inside the snap's private mount namespace and causing snap-confine to execute arbitrary code and hence gain privilege escalation. Fixed in snapd versions 2.54.3+18.04, 2.54.3+20.04 and 2.54.3+21.10.1", "poc": {"reference": ["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/170176/snap-confine-must_mkdir_and_open_with_perms-Race-Condition.html", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/02/23/1"], "github": ["https://github.com/ARPSyndicate/cvemon", "https://github.com/bollwarm/SecToolSet", "https://github.com/deeexcee-io/CVE-2021-44731-snap-confine-SUID", "https://github.com/teresaweber685/book_list"]}}
