{"id": "CVE-2021-43808", "product": "framework", "version": "n/a", "vulnerability": ["CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"], "description": "Laravel is a web application framework. Laravel prior to versions 8.75.0, 7.30.6, and 6.20.42 contain a possible cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Blade templating engine. A broken HTML element may be clicked and the user taken to another location in their browser due to XSS. This is due to the user being able to guess the parent placeholder SHA-1 hash by trying common names of sections. If the parent template contains an exploitable HTML structure an XSS vulnerability can be exposed. This vulnerability has been patched in versions 8.75.0, 7.30.6, and 6.20.42 by determining the parent placeholder at runtime and using a random hash that is unique to each request.", "poc": {"reference": ["No PoCs from references."], "github": ["https://github.com/eeenvik1/scripts_for_YouTrack", "https://github.com/myOwn3HectarsOfCode/ProjektLaravel"]}}
