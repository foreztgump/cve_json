    "description": "NETGEAR WAC104 devices before 1.0.4.15 are affected by an authentication bypass vulnerability in /usr/sbin/mini_httpd, allowing an unauthenticated attacker to invoke any action by adding the &currentsetting.htm substring to the HTTP query, a related issue to CVE-2020-27866. This directly allows the attacker to change the web UI password, and eventually to enable debug mode (telnetd) and gain a shell on the device as the admin limited-user account (however, escalation to root is simple because of weak permissions on the /etc/ directory).",
