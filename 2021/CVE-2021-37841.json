If a low-privileged account is able to access the server running the Windows containers, it can lead to a full container compromise in both process isolation and Hyper-V isolation modes. This security issue leads an attacker with low privilege to read, write and possibly even execute code inside the containers.", "poc": {"reference": ["https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/release-notes/"], "github": ["No PoCs found on GitHub currently."]}}
