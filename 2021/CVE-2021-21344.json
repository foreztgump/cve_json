In XStream before version 1.4.16, there is a vulnerability which may allow a remote attacker to load and execute arbitrary code from a remote host only by manipulating the processed input stream. No user is affected, who followed the recommendation to setup XStream's security framework with a whitelist limited to the minimal required types. If you rely on XStream's default blacklist of the Security Framework, you will have to use at least version 1.4.16.", "poc": {"reference": ["https://www.oracle.com//security-alerts/cpujul2021.html", "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2022.html", "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html"], "github": ["https://github.com/20142995/sectool", "https://github.com/ARPSyndicate/cvemon", "https://github.com/EdgeSecurityTeam/Vulnerability", "https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-ide-vulscanner", "https://github.com/Whoopsunix/PPPVULNS", "https://github.com/fynch3r/Gadgets", "https://github.com/tzwlhack/Vulnerability", "https://github.com/x-poc/xstream-poc"]}}
