    "description": "The Happy Addons for Elementor WordPress plugin before 2.24.0, Happy Addons Pro for Elementor WordPress plugin before 1.17.0 have a number of widgets that are vulnerable to stored Cross-Site Scripting(XSS) by lower-privileged users such as contributors, all via a similar method: The \u201cCard\u201d widget accepts a \u201ctitle_tag\u201d parameter. Although the element control lists a fixed set of possible html tags, it is possible to send a \u2018save_builder\u2019 request with the \u201cheading_tag\u201d set to \u201cscript\u201d, and the actual \u201ctitle\u201d parameter set to JavaScript to be executed within the script tags added by the \u201cheading_tag\u201d parameter.",
