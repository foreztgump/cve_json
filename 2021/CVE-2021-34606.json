Local access is required to successfully exploit this vulnerability. This means the potential attacker must have access to the system and sufficient file-write privileges. If exploited, the attacker could place a malicious DLL file on the system, that when running XINJE XD/E Series PLC Program Tool will allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of another user's account.", "poc": {"reference": ["https://claroty.com/2022/05/11/blog-research-from-project-file-to-code-execution-exploiting-vulnerabilities-in-xinje-plc-program-tool/"], "github": ["No PoCs found on GitHub currently."]}}
