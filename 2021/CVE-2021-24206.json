    ],
    "description": "In the Elementor Website Builder WordPress plugin before 3.1.4, the image box widget (includes/widgets/image-box.php) accepts a \u2018title_size\u2019 parameter. Although the element control lists a fixed set of possible html tags, it is possible for a user with Contributor or above permissions to send a modified \u2018save_builder\u2019 request containing JavaScript in the \u2018title_size\u2019 parameter, which is not filtered and is output without escaping. This JavaScript will then be executed when the saved page is viewed or previewed.",
