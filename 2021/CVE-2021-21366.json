This may lead to unexpected syntactic changes during XML processing in some downstream applications. This is fixed in version 0.5.0. As a workaround downstream applications can validate the input and reject the maliciously crafted documents.", "poc": {"reference": ["No PoCs from references."], "github": ["https://github.com/ARPSyndicate/cvemon", "https://github.com/AntonyLockeUK/Antony-Locke-Bouremouth", "https://github.com/malotian/angular-with-nodejs-authn", "https://github.com/sourchib/Framework7_Cordova"]}}
