    "version": "2.0.9< 2.0.9 ",
    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-79 Cross-site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "description": "The TranslatePress WordPress plugin before 2.0.9 does not implement a proper sanitisation on the translated strings. The 'trp_sanitize_string' function only removes script tag with a regex, still allowing other HTML tags and attributes to execute javascript, which could lead to authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting issues.",
