When the size information in metadata of the bmp is out of range, it returns without assign memory buffer to `pb->pdata` and did not exit the program. So the program crashes when it tries to access the pb->data, in jfif_encode() at jfif.c:763. This is due to the incomplete patch for CVE-2020-13438.", "poc": {"reference": ["https://github.com/rockcarry/ffjpeg/issues/47"], "github": ["https://github.com/ARPSyndicate/cvemon", "https://github.com/Marsman1996/pocs"]}}
