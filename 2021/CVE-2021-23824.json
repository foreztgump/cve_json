When using attributes without quotes in the template, an attacker can manipulate the input to introduce additional attributes, potentially executing code. This may lead to a Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, assuming an attacker can influence the value entered into the template. If the template is used to render user-generated content, this vulnerability may escalate to a persistent XSS vulnerability.", "poc": {"reference": ["https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-UNMANAGED-CROW-2336164"], "github": ["https://github.com/Kirill89/Kirill89"]}}
