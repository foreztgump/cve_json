    "description": "The Absolute Reviews plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.8.

This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to save meta tags via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
