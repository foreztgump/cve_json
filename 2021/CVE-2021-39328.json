        "CWE-79 Cross-site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "description": "The Simple Job Board WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting due to insufficient escaping on the $job_board_privacy_policy_label variable echo'd out via the ~/admin/settings/class-simple-job-board-settings-privacy.php file which allowed attackers with administrative user access to inject arbitrary web scripts, in versions up to and including 2.9.4. This affects multi-site installations where unfiltered_html is disabled for administrators, and sites where unfiltered_html is disabled.",
