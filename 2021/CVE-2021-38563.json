    "description": "An issue was discovered in Foxit PDF Reader before 11.0.1 and PDF Editor before 11.0.1. It mishandles situations in which an array size (derived from a /Size entry) is smaller than the maximum indirect object number, and thus there is an attempted incorrect array access (leading to a NULL pointer dereference, or out-of-bounds read or write).",
