    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-338 Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)"
    ],
    "description": "A cryptographically weak pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) is used during authentication to the Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS web interface. This enables an authenticated attacker, with the capability to observe their own authentication secrets over a long duration on the PAN-OS appliance, to impersonate another authenticated web interface administrator's session. This issue impacts: PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.19; PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.0.14; PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.10; PAN-OS 10.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 10.0.4. PAN-OS 10.1 versions are not impacted.",
