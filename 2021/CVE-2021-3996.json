{"id": "CVE-2021-3996", "product": "util-linux", "version": "n/a", "vulnerability": ["CWE-552 - Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties"], "description": "A logic error was found in the libmount library of util-linux in the function that allows an unprivileged user to unmount a FUSE filesystem. This flaw allows a local user on a vulnerable system to unmount other users' filesystems that are either world-writable themselves (like /tmp) or mounted in a world-writable directory. An attacker may use this flaw to cause a denial of service to applications that use the affected filesystems.", "poc": {"reference": ["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/170176/snap-confine-must_mkdir_and_open_with_perms-Race-Condition.html"], "github": ["https://github.com/ARPSyndicate/cvemon", "https://github.com/toyhoshi/helm"]}}
