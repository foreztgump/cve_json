An improper escaping of the shell command, while calling the ansible_runner.interface.run_command, can lead to parameters getting executed as host's shell command. A developer could unintentionally write code that gets executed in the host rather than the virtual environment.", "poc": {"reference": ["No PoCs from references."], "github": ["https://github.com/ARPSyndicate/cvemon"]}}
