        "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
        "CWE-79 Cross-site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "description": "The St-Daily-Tip WordPress plugin through 4.7 does not have any CSRF check in place when saving its 'Default Text to Display if no tips' setting, and was also lacking sanitisation as well as escaping before outputting it the page. This could allow attacker to make logged in administrators set a malicious payload in it, leading to a Stored Cross-Site Scripting issue",
