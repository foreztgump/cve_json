{"id": "CVE-2021-42716", "product": "n/a", "version": "n/a", "vulnerability": ["n/a"], "description": "An issue was discovered in stb stb_image.h 2.27. The PNM loader incorrectly interpreted 16-bit PGM files as 8-bit when converting to RGBA, leading to a buffer overflow when later reinterpreting the result as a 16-bit buffer. An attacker could potentially have crashed a service using stb_image, or read up to 1024 bytes of non-consecutive heap data without control over the read location.", "poc": {"reference": ["https://github.com/nothings/stb/issues/1166", "https://github.com/nothings/stb/issues/1225"], "github": ["No PoCs found on GitHub currently."]}}
