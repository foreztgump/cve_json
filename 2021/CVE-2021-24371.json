    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"
    ],
    "description": "The Import feature of the RSVPMaker WordPress plugin before 8.7.3 (/wp-admin/tools.php?page=rsvpmaker_export_screen) takes an URL input and calls curl on it, without first validating it to ensure it's a remote one. As a result, a high privilege user could use that feature to scan the internal network via a SSRF attack.",
