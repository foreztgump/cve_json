{"id": "CVE-2021-21305", "product": "carrierwave", "version": "n/a", "vulnerability": ["CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')"], "description": "CarrierWave is an open-source RubyGem which provides a simple and flexible way to upload files from Ruby applications. In CarrierWave before versions 1.3.2 and 2.1.1, there is a code injection vulnerability. The \"#manipulate!\" method inappropriately evals the content of mutation option(:read/:write), allowing attackers to craft a string that can be executed as a Ruby code. If an application developer supplies untrusted inputs to the option, it will lead to remote code execution(RCE). This is fixed in versions 1.3.2 and 2.1.1.", "poc": {"reference": ["https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave/security/advisories/GHSA-cf3w-g86h-35x4"], "github": ["No PoCs found on GitHub currently."]}}
