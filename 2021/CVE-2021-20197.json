When these utilities are run as a privileged user (presumably as part of a script updating binaries across different users), an unprivileged user can trick these utilities into getting ownership of arbitrary files through a symlink.", "poc": {"reference": ["No PoCs from references."], "github": ["https://github.com/vincent-deng/veracode-container-security-finding-parser"]}}
