    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:netfilter: conntrack: Make global sysctls readonly in non-init netnsThese sysctls point to global variables:- NF_SYSCTL_CT_MAX (&nf_conntrack_max)- NF_SYSCTL_CT_EXPECT_MAX (&nf_ct_expect_max)- NF_SYSCTL_CT_BUCKETS (&nf_conntrack_htable_size_user)Because their data pointers are not updated to point to per-netnsstructures, they must be marked read-only in a non-init_net ns.Otherwise, changes in any net namespace are reflected in (leaked into)all other net namespaces. This problem has existed since theintroduction of net namespaces.The current logic marks them read-only only if the net namespace isowned by an unprivileged user (other than init_user_ns).Commit d0febd81ae77 (\"netfilter: conntrack: re-visit sysctls inunprivileged namespaces\") \"exposes all sysctls even if the namespace isunpriviliged.\" Since we need to mark them readonly in any case, we canforego the unprivileged user check altogether.",
