{"id": "CVE-2021-21235", "product": "exif-rs", "version": "n/a", "vulnerability": ["CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"], "description": "kamadak-exif is an exif parsing library written in pure Rust. In kamadak-exif version 0.5.2, there is an infinite loop in parsing crafted PNG files. Specifically, reader::read_from_container can cause an infinite loop when a crafted PNG file is given. This is fixed in version 0.5.3. No workaround is available. Applications that do not pass files with the PNG signature to Reader::read_from_container are not affected.", "poc": {"reference": ["No PoCs from references."], "github": ["https://github.com/Artisan-Lab/Rust-memory-safety-bugs"]}}
