{"id": "CVE-2021-1590", "product": "Cisco NX-OS Software ", "version": "n/a", "vulnerability": ["CWE-787"], "description": "A vulnerability in the implementation of the system login block-for command for Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a login process to unexpectedly restart, causing a denial of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability is due to a logic error in the implementation of the system login block-for command when an attack is detected and acted upon. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by performing a brute-force login attack on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a login process to reload, which could result in a delay during authentication to the affected device.", "poc": {"reference": ["No PoCs from references."], "github": ["https://github.com/p1ay8y3ar/cve_monitor"]}}
