    "description": "An issue was discovered in FIS GT.M through V7.0-000 (related to the YottaDB code base). Using crafted input, an attacker can cause a call to $Extract to force an signed integer holding the size of a buffer to take on a large negative number, which is then used as the length of a memcpy call that occurs on the stack, causing a buffer overflow.",
