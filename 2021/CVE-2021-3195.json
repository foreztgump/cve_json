    "description": "** DISPUTED ** bitcoind in Bitcoin Core through 0.21.0 can create a new file in an arbitrary directory (e.g., outside the ~/.bitcoin directory) via a dumpwallet RPC call. NOTE: this reportedly does not violate the security model of Bitcoin Core, but can violate the security model of a fork that has implemented dumpwallet restrictions.",
