It's possible tofill up the neighbour table with enough entries that it will overflow forvalid connections after that.This behaviour is more prevalent after commit 58956317c8de (\"neighbor:Improve garbage collection\") is applied, as it prevents removal fromentries that are not NUD_FAILED, unless they are more than 5s old.",
