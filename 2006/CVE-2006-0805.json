    "description": "The CAPTCHA functionality in php-Nuke 6.0 through 7.9 uses fixed challenge/response pairs that only vary once per day based on the User Agent (HTTP_USER_AGENT), which allows remote attackers to bypass CAPTCHA controls by fixing the User Agent, performing a valid challenge/response, then replaying that pair in the random_num and gfx_check parameters.",
