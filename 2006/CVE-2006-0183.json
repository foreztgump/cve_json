NOTE: this issue might be resultant from the poor authentication as identified by CVE-2006-0182.  Since the design of the product allows the administrator to edit the code, perhaps this issue should not be included in CVE, except as a consequence of CVE-2006-0182.", "poc": {"reference": ["http://evuln.com/vulns/25/summary.html"], "github": ["No PoCs found on GitHub currently."]}}
