    "description": "An Origin Validation Error in the elysia-cors library thru 1.3.0 allows attackers to bypass Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) restrictions. The library incorrectly validates the supplied origin by checking if it is a substring of any domain in the site's CORS policy, rather than performing an exact match. For example, a malicious origin like \"notexample.com\", \"example.common.net\" is whitelisted when the site's CORS policy specifies \"example.com.\" This vulnerability enables unauthorized access to user data on sites using the elysia-cors library for CORS validation.",
