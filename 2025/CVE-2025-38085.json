    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm/hugetlb: fix huge_pmd_unshare() vs GUP-fast racehuge_pmd_unshare() drops a reference on a page table that may havepreviously been shared across processes, potentially turning it into anormal page table used in another process in which unrelated VMAs canafterwards be installed.If this happens in the middle of a concurrent gup_fast(), gup_fast() couldend up walking the page tables of another process.  While I don't see anyway in which that immediately leads to kernel memory corruption, it isreally weird and unexpected.Fix it with an explicit broadcast IPI through tlb_remove_table_sync_one(),just like we do in khugepaged when removing page tables for a THPcollapse.",
