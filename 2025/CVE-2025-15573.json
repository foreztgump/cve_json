    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation"
    ],
    "description": "The affected devices do not validate the server certificate when connecting to the SolaX Cloud MQTTS server hosted in the Alibaba Cloud (mqtt001.solaxcloud.com, TCP 8883). This allows attackers in a man-in-the-middle position to act as the legitimate MQTT server and issue arbitrary commands to devices.",
