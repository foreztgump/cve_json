    "description": "An Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability in the Connectivity Fault Management (CFM) daemon\u00a0and the Connectivity Fault Management Manager (cfmman)\u00a0of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved on PTX10001-36MR, PTX10002-36QDD, PTX10004, PTX10008, PTX10016  allows an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).An attacker on an adjacent device sending specific valid traffic can cause cfmd to spike the CPU to 100% and cfmman's memory to leak, eventually to cause the FPC crash and restart.Continued receipt and processes of these specific valid packets will sustain the Denial of Service (DoS) condition.An indicator of compromise is to watch\u00a0for an increase in cfmman memory rising over time by issuing the following command and evaluating the\u00a0RSS\u00a0number.\u00a0If the RSS is growing into GBs then consider restarting the device to temporarily clear memory. \u00a0 user@device> show system processes node fpc<num> detail | match cfmmanExample:\u00a0\u00a0 show system processes node fpc0 detail | match cfmman\u00a0\u00a0 F S UID \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  PID\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0PPID  PGID \u00a0 SID\u00a0 \u00a0C PRI  NI\u00a0 ADDR SZ\u00a0 \u00a0 WCHAN \u00a0  RSS\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0PSR STIME TTY \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  TIME\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0CMD\u00a0 4 S root\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 15204 \u00a0 \u00a0 1\u00a0 \u00a0 15204\u00a0 15204  0  80\u00a0 0\u00a0 \u00a0- 90802\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 113652\u00a0 \u00a04\u00a0 Sep25 ?\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a000:15:28 /usr/bin/cfmman -p /var/pfe -o -c /usr/conf/cfmman-cfg-active.xmlThis issue affects Junos OS Evolved on\u00a0PTX10001-36MR, PTX10002-36QDD, PTX10004, PTX10008, PTX10016:  *  from 23.2R1-EVO before 23.2R2-S4-EVO,   *  from 23.4 before 23.4R2-S4-EVO,   *  from 24.2 before 24.2R2-EVO,   *  from 24.4 before 24.4R1-S2-EVO, 24.4R2-EVO.This issue does not affect Junos OS Evolved on\u00a0PTX10001-36MR, PTX10002-36QDD, PTX10004, PTX10008, PTX10016  before 23.2R1-EVO.",
