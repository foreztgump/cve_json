        "CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "description": "A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the MFER parsing functionality of The Biosig Project libbiosig 3.9.0 and Master Branch (35a819fa). A specially crafted MFER file can lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.This vulnerability manifests on line 8744 of biosig.c on the current master branch (35a819fa), when the Tag is 3: \t\t\t\telse if (tag==3) {\n\t\t\t\t\t// character code\n\t\t\t\t\tchar v[17];\t\t// [1]\n\t\t\t\t\tif (len>16) fprintf(stderr,\"Warning MFER tag2 incorrect length %i>16\\n\",len);\n\t\t\t\t\tcurPos += ifread(&v,1,len,hdr);\n\t\t\t\t\tv[len]  = 0; In this case, the overflowed buffer is the newly-declared `v` \\[1\\] instead of `buf`. Since `v` is only 17 bytes large, much smaller values of `len` (even those encoded using a single octet) can trigger an overflow in this code path.",
