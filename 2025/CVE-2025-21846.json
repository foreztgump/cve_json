    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:acct: perform last write from workqueueIn [1] it was reported that the acct(2) system call can be used totrigger NULL deref in cases where it is set to write to a file thattriggers an internal lookup. This can e.g., happen when pointing acc(2)to /sys/power/resume. At the point the where the write to this filehappens the calling task has already exited and called exit_fs(). Alookup will thus trigger a NULL-deref when accessing current->fs.Reorganize the code so that the the final write happens from theworkqueue but with the caller's credentials. This preserves the(strange) permission model and has almost no regression risk.This api should stop to exist though.",
