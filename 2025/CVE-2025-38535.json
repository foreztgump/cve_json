    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:phy: tegra: xusb: Fix unbalanced regulator disable in UTMI PHY modeWhen transitioning from USB_ROLE_DEVICE to USB_ROLE_NONE, the codeassumed that the regulator should be disabled. However, if the regulatoris marked as always-on, regulator_is_enabled() continues to return true,leading to an incorrect attempt to disable a regulator which is notenabled.This can result in warnings such as:[  250.155624] WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 7326 at drivers/regulator/core.c:3004_regulator_disable+0xe4/0x1a0[  250.155652] unbalanced disables for VIN_SYS_5V0To fix this, we move the regulator control logic intotegra186_xusb_padctl_id_override() function since it's directly relatedto the ID override state. The regulator is now only disabled when the roletransitions from USB_ROLE_HOST to USB_ROLE_NONE, by checking the VBUS_IDregister. This ensures that regulator enable/disable operations areproperly balanced and only occur when actually transitioning to/from hostmode.",
