    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:pinctrl: qcom: msm: mark certain pins as invalid for interruptsOn some platforms, the UFS-reset pin has no interrupt logic in TLMM butis nevertheless registered as a GPIO in the kernel. This enables theuser-space to trigger a BUG() in the pinctrl-msm driver by running, forexample: `gpiomon -c 0 113` on RB2.The exact culprit is requesting pins whose intr_detection_width settingis not 1 or 2 for interrupts. This hits a BUG() inmsm_gpio_irq_set_type(). Potentially crashing the kernel due to aninvalid request from user-space is not optimal, so let's go through thepins and mark those that would fail the check as invalid for the irq chipas we should not even register them as available irqs.This function can be extended if we determine that there are morecorner-cases like this.",
