    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:scsi: lpfc: Check for hdwq null ptr when cleaning up lpfc_vport structureIf a call to lpfc_sli4_read_rev() from lpfc_sli4_hba_setup() fails, theresultant cleanup routine lpfc_sli4_vport_delete_fcp_xri_aborted() mayoccur before sli4_hba.hdwqs are allocated.  This may result in a nullpointer dereference when attempting to take the abts_io_buf_list_lock forthe first hardware queue.  Fix by adding a null ptr check onphba->sli4_hba.hdwq and early return because this situation means theremust have been an error during port initialization.",
