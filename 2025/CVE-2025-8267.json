    "vulnerability": [
        "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"
    ],
    "description": "Versions of the package ssrfcheck before 1.2.0 are vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) due to an incomplete denylist of IP address ranges. Specifically, the package fails to classify the reserved IP address space 224.0.0.0/4 (Multicast) as invalid. This oversight allows attackers to craft requests targeting these multicast addresses.",
