    "description": "curl's websocket code did not update the 32 bit mask pattern for each new outgoing frame as the specification says. Instead it used a fixed mask thatpersisted and was used throughout the entire connection.A predictable mask pattern allows for a malicious server to induce trafficbetween the two communicating parties that could be interpreted by an involvedproxy (configured or transparent) as genuine, real, HTTP traffic with contentand thereby poison its cache. That cached poisoned content could then beserved to all users of that proxy.",
