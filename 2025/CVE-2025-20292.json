        "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')"
    ],
    "description": "A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute a command injection attack on the underlying operating system of an affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid user credentials on the affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by entering crafted input as the argument of an affected CLI command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read and write files on the underlying operating system with the privileges of a non-root user account. File system access is limited to the permissions that are granted to that non-root user account.",
