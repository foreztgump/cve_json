    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')"
    ],
    "description": "The endpoint POST /api/staff/get-new-tickets concatenates the user-controlled parameter departmentId directly into the SQL WHERE clause without parameter binding. As a result, an authenticated staff user (level \u00e2\u2030\u00a5 1) can inject SQL to alter the filter logic, effectively bypassing department scoping and disclosing tickets beyond their intended access.This issue affects OpenSupports: 4.11.0.",
