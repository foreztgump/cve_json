    "description": "An unauthenticated command injection vulnerability exists in the Start_EPI function of the httpd binary on Linksys E1200 v2 routers (Firmware E1200_v2.0.11.001_us.tar.gz). The vulnerability occurs because user-supplied CGI parameters (wl_ant, wl_ssid, wl_rate, ttcp_num, ttcp_ip, ttcp_size) are concatenated into system command strings without proper sanitization and executed via wl_exec_cmd. Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the device without authentication.",
