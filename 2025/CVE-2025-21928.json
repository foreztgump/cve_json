    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:HID: intel-ish-hid: Fix use-after-free issue in ishtp_hid_remove()The system can experience a random crash a few minutes after the driver isremoved. This issue occurs due to improper handling of memory freeing inthe ishtp_hid_remove() function.The function currently frees the `driver_data` directly within the loopthat destroys the HID devices, which can lead to accessing freed memory.Specifically, `hid_destroy_device()` uses `driver_data` when it calls`hid_ishtp_set_feature()` to power off the sensor, so freeing`driver_data` beforehand can result in accessing invalid memory.This patch resolves the issue by storing the `driver_data` in a temporaryvariable before calling `hid_destroy_device()`, and then freeing the`driver_data` after the device is destroyed.",
