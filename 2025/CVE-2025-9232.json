    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read"
    ],
    "description": "Issue summary: An application using the OpenSSL HTTP client API functions maytrigger an out-of-bounds read if the 'no_proxy' environment variable is set andthe host portion of the authority component of the HTTP URL is an IPv6 address.Impact summary: An out-of-bounds read can trigger a crash which leads toDenial of Service for an application.The OpenSSL HTTP client API functions can be used directly by applicationsbut they are also used by the OCSP client functions and CMP (CertificateManagement Protocol) client implementation in OpenSSL. However the URLs usedby these implementations are unlikely to be controlled by an attacker.In this vulnerable code the out of bounds read can only trigger a crash.Furthermore the vulnerability requires an attacker-controlled URL to bepassed from an application to the OpenSSL function and the user has to havea 'no_proxy' environment variable set. For the aforementioned reasons theissue was assessed as Low severity.The vulnerable code was introduced in the following patch releases:3.0.16, 3.1.8, 3.2.4, 3.3.3, 3.4.0 and 3.5.0.The FIPS modules in 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by thisissue, as the HTTP client implementation is outside the OpenSSL FIPS moduleboundary.",
