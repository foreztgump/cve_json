    "description": "An unauthenticated command injection vulnerability exists in the ToToLink LR1200GB Router firmware V9.1.0u.6619_B20230130 within the cstecgi.cgi binary (sub_41EC68 function). The binary reads the \"imei\" parameter from a web request and verifies only that it is 15 characters long. The parameter is then directly inserted into a system command using sprintf() and executed with system(). Maliciously crafted IMEI input can execute arbitrary commands on the router without authentication.",
