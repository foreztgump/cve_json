    "id": "CVE-2025-64436",
    "product": "kubevirt",
    "version": "<= 1.5.0 ",
    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management",
        "CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions"
    ],
    "description": "KubeVirt is a virtual machine management add-on for Kubernetes. In 1.5.0 and earlier, the permissions granted to the virt-handler service account, such as the ability to update VMI and patch nodes, could be abused to force a VMI migration to an attacker-controlled node. This vulnerability could otherwise allow an attacker to mark all nodes as unschedulable, potentially forcing the migration or creation of privileged pods onto a compromised node.",
