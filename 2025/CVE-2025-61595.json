    "description": "MANTRA is a purpose-built RWA Layer 1 Blockchain, capable of adherence to real world regulatory requirements. Versions 4.0.1 and below do not enforce the tx gas limit in its send hooks. Send hooks can spend more gas than what remains in tx, combined with recursive calls in the wasm contract, potentially amplifying the gas consumption exponentially. This is fixed in version 4.0.2.",
