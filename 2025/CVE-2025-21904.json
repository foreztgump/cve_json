    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:caif_virtio: fix wrong pointer check in cfv_probe()del_vqs() frees virtqueues, therefore cfv->vq_tx pointer should be checkedfor NULL before calling it, not cfv->vdev. Also the current implementationis redundant because the pointer cfv->vdev is dereferenced before it ischecked for NULL.Fix this by checking cfv->vq_tx for NULL instead of cfv->vdev beforecalling del_vqs().",
