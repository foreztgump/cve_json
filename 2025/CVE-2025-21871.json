    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:tee: optee: Fix supplicant wait loopOP-TEE supplicant is a user-space daemon and it's possible for itbe hung or crashed or killed in the middle of processing an OP-TEERPC call. It becomes more complicated when there is incorrect shutdownordering of the supplicant process vs the OP-TEE client application whichcan eventually lead to system hang-up waiting for the closure of theclient application.Allow the client process waiting in kernel for supplicant response tobe killed rather than indefinitely waiting in an unkillable state. Also,a normal uninterruptible wait should not have resulted in the hung-taskwatchdog getting triggered, but the endless loop would.This fixes issues observed during system reboot/shutdown when supplicantgot hung for some reason or gets crashed/killed which lead to clientgetting hung in an unkillable state. It in turn lead to system being inhung up state requiring hard power off/on to recover.",
