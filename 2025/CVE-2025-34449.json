        "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer"
    ],
    "description": "Genymobile/scrcpy versions up to and including 3.3.3 and prior to commit 3e40b24 contain a\u00c2\u00a0global buffer overflow vulnerability in the function sc_read32be, invoked via sc_device_msg_deserialize() and process_msgs().
