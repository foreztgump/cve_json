    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-862 Missing Authorization"
    ],
    "description": "The SEO Metrics plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation due to missing authorization checks in both the seo_metrics_handle_connect_button_click() AJAX handler and the seo_metrics_handle_custom_endpoint() function in versions 1.0.5 through 1.0.15. Because the AJAX action only verifies a nonce, without checking the caller\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s capabilities, a subscriber-level user can retrieve the token and then access the custom endpoint to obtain full administrator cookies.",
