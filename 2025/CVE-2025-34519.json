    "description": "Ilevia\u00a0EVE X1 Server firmware versions \u2264 4.7.18.0.eden contain an insecure hashing algorithm vulnerability.\u00a0The product stores passwords using the MD5 hash function without applying a per\u2011password salt.\u00a0Because MD5 is a fast, unsalted hash, an attacker who obtains the password database can efficiently perform offline dictionary, rainbow\u2011table, or brute\u2011force attacks to recover the original passwords. Ilevia has declined to service this vulnerability, and recommends that customers not expose port 8080 to the internet.",
