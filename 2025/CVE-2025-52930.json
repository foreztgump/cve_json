    "description": "A memory corruption vulnerability exists in the BMPv3 RLE Decoding functionality of the SAIL Image Decoding Library v0.9.8. When decompressing the image data from a specially crafted .bmp file, a heap-based buffer overflow can occur which allows for remote code execution. An attacker will need to convince the library to read a file to trigger this vulnerability.",
