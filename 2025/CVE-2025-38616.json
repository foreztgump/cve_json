    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:tls: handle data disappearing from under the TLS ULPTLS expects that it owns the receive queue of the TCP socket.This cannot be guaranteed in case the reader of the TCP socketentered before the TLS ULP was installed, or uses some non-standardread API (eg. zerocopy ones). Replace the WARN_ON() and a buggyearly exit (which leaves anchor pointing to a freed skb) with realerror handling. Wipe the parsing state and tell the reader to retry.We already reload the anchor every time we (re)acquire the socket lock,so the only condition we need to avoid is an out of bounds read(not having enough bytes in the socket for previously parsed record len).If some data was read from under TLS but there's enough in the queuewe'll reload and decrypt what is most likely not a valid TLS record.Leading to some undefined behavior from TLS perspective (corruptinga stream? missing an alert? missing an attack?) but no kernel crashshould take place.",
