    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:gve: prevent ethtool ops after shutdownA crash can occur if an ethtool operation is invokedafter shutdown() is called.shutdown() is invoked during system shutdown to stop DMA operationswithout performing expensive deallocations. It is discouraged tounregister the netdev in this path, so the device may still be visibleto userspace and kernel helpers.In gve, shutdown() tears down most internal data structures. If anethtool operation is dispatched after shutdown(), it will dereferencefreed or NULL pointers, leading to a kernel panic. While gracefulshutdown normally quiesces userspace before invoking the rebootsyscall, forced shutdowns (as observed on GCP VMs) can still triggerthis path.Fix by calling netif_device_detach() in shutdown().This marks the device as detached so the ethtool ioctl handlerwill skip dispatching operations to the driver.",
