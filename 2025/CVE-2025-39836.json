    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:efi: stmm: Fix incorrect buffer allocation methodThe communication buffer allocated by setup_mm_hdr() is later on passedto tee_shm_register_kernel_buf(). The latter expects those buffers to becontiguous pages, but setup_mm_hdr() just uses kmalloc(). That can causevarious corruptions or BUGs, specifically since commit 9aec2fb0fd5e(\"slab: allocate frozen pages\"), though it was broken before as well.Fix this by using alloc_pages_exact() instead of kmalloc().",
