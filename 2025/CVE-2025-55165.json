        "CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor"
    ],
    "description": "Autocaliweb is a web app that offers an interface for browsing, reading, and downloading eBooks using a valid Calibre database. Prior to version 0.8.3, the debug pack generated by Autocaliweb can expose sensitive configuration data, including API keys. This occurs because the to_dict() method, used to serialize configuration for the debug pack, doesn't adequately filter out sensitive fields such as API tokens. Users, unaware of the full contents, might share these debug packs, inadvertently leaking their private API keys. This issue has been patched in version 0.8.3.",
