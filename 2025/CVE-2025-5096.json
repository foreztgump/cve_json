    "description": "The TablePress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to DOM-Based Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'data-caption', 'data-s-content-padding', 'data-s-title', and 'data-footer' data-attributes in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
