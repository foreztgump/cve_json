    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-862 Missing Authorization"
    ],
    "description": "The GSheetConnector For Gravity Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass in versions less than, or equal to, 1.3.27. This is due to a missing capability check on the 'install_plugin' function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above to install plugins on the target site and potentially achieve arbitrary code execution on the server under certain conditions.",
