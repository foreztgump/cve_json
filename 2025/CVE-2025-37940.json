    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ftrace: Add cond_resched() to ftrace_graph_set_hash()When the kernel contains a large number of functions that can be traced,the loop in ftrace_graph_set_hash() may take a lot of time to execute.This may trigger the softlockup watchdog.Add cond_resched() within the loop to allow the kernel to remainresponsive even when processing a large number of functions.This matches the cond_resched() that is used in other locations of thecode that iterates over all functions that can be traced.",
