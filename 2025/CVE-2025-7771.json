        "CWE-782: Exposed IOCTL with Insufficient Access Control"
    ],
    "description": "ThrottleStop.sys, a legitimate driver, exposes two IOCTL interfaces that allow arbitrary read and write access to physical memory via the MmMapIoSpace function. This insecure implementation can be exploited by a malicious user-mode application to patch the running Windows kernel and invoke arbitrary kernel functions with ring-0 privileges. The vulnerability enables local attackers to execute arbitrary code in kernel context, resulting in privilege escalation and potential follow-on attacks, such as disabling security software or bypassing kernel-level protections.\u00c2\u00a0ThrottleStop.sys version 3.0.0.0 and possibly others are affected. Apply updates per vendor instructions.",
