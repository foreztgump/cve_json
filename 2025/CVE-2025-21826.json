    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:netfilter: nf_tables: reject mismatching sum of field_len with set key lengthThe field length description provides the length of each separated keyfield in the concatenation, each field gets rounded up to 32-bits tocalculate the pipapo rule width from pipapo_init(). The set key lengthprovides the total size of the key aligned to 32-bits.Register-based arithmetics still allows for combining mismatching setkey length and field length description, eg. set key length 10 and fielddescription [ 5, 4 ] leading to pipapo width of 12.",
