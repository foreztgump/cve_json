    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:comedi: pcl812: Fix bit shift out of boundsWhen checking for a supported IRQ number, the following test is used:\tif ((1 << it->options[1]) & board->irq_bits) {However, `it->options[i]` is an unchecked `int` value from userspace, sothe shift amount could be negative or out of bounds.  Fix the test byrequiring `it->options[1]` to be within bounds before proceeding withthe original test.  Valid `it->options[1]` values that select the IRQwill be in the range [1,15]. The value 0 explicitly disables the use ofinterrupts.",
