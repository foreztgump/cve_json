    "product": "h11",
    "version": "< 0.16.0 ",
    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-444: Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')"
    ],
    "description": "h11 is a Python implementation of HTTP/1.1. Prior to version 0.16.0, a leniency in h11's parsing of line terminators in chunked-coding message bodies can lead to request smuggling vulnerabilities under certain conditions. This issue has been patched in version 0.16.0. Since exploitation requires the combination of buggy h11 with a buggy (reverse) proxy, fixing either component is sufficient to mitigate this issue.",
