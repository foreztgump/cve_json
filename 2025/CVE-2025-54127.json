        "CWE-1188: Insecure Default Initialization of Resource"
    ],
    "description": "HAXcms with nodejs backend allows users to start the server in any HAXsite or HAXcms instance. In versions 11.0.6 and below, the NodeJS version of HAXcms uses an insecure default configuration designed for local development. The default configuration does not perform authorization or authentication checks. If a user were to deploy haxcms-nodejs without modifying the default settings, \u2018HAXCMS_DISABLE_JWT_CHECKS\u2018 would be set to \u2018true\u2018 and their deployment would lack session authentication. This is fixed in version 11.0.7.",
