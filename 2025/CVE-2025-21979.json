    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:wifi: cfg80211: cancel wiphy_work before freeing wiphyA wiphy_work can be queued from the moment the wiphy is allocated andinitialized (i.e. wiphy_new_nm). When a wiphy_work is queued, therdev::wiphy_work is getting queued.If wiphy_free is called before the rdev::wiphy_work had a chance to run,the wiphy memory will be freed, and then when it eventally gets to runit'll use invalid memory.Fix this by canceling the work before freeing the wiphy.",
