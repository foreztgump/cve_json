        "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization"
    ],
    "description": "A vulnerability exists in Apache ActiveMQ Artemis whereby a user with the createDurableQueue or createNonDurableQueue permission on an address can augment the routing-type supported by that address even if said user doesn't have the createAddress permission for that particular address. When combined with the send permission and automatic queue creation a user could successfully send a message with a routing-type not supported by the address when that message should actually be rejected on the basis that the user doesn't have permission to change the routing-type of the address.This issue affects Apache ActiveMQ Artemis from 2.0.0 through 2.39.0.Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.40.0 which fixes the issue.",
