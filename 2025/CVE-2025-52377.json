The vulnerability is present in the web management interface's ping and traceroute functionality, specifically in the /web/um_ping_set.cgi endpoint. The application fails to properly sanitize user input in the `Ping_host_text` parameter before passing it to the underlying system command, allowing attackers to inject and execute arbitrary shell commands as the root user.",
