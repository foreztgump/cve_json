    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:md/md-bitmap: fix GPF in bitmap_get_stats()The commit message of commit 6ec1f0239485 (\"md/md-bitmap: fix statscollection for external bitmaps\") states:    Remove the external bitmap check as the statistics should be    available regardless of bitmap storage location.    Return -EINVAL only for invalid bitmap with no storage (neither in    superblock nor in external file).But, the code does not adhere to the above, as it does only check fora valid super-block for \"internal\" bitmaps. Hence, we observe:Oops: GPF, probably for non-canonical address 0x1cd66f1f40000028RIP: 0010:bitmap_get_stats+0x45/0xd0Call Trace: seq_read_iter+0x2b9/0x46a seq_read+0x12f/0x180 proc_reg_read+0x57/0xb0 vfs_read+0xf6/0x380 ksys_read+0x6d/0xf0 do_syscall_64+0x8c/0x1b0 entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7eWe fix this by checking the existence of a super-block for both theinternal and external case.",
