    "description": "CloudClassroom-PHP-Project v1.0 contains a critical SQL Injection vulnerability in the loginlinkadmin.php component. The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the admin login form before directly including it in SQL queries. This allows unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary SQL payloads and bypass authentication, gaining unauthorized administrative access. The vulnerability is triggered when an attacker supplies specially crafted input in the username field, such as ' OR '1'='1, leading to complete compromise of the login mechanism and potential exposure of sensitive backend data.",
