They are just harder totrigger.The solution is similar. Use a separate flag to track the condition'socket state prevent any additional subflow creation' protected by thefallback lock.The socket fallback makes such flag true, and also receiving or sendingan MP_FAIL option.The field 'allow_infinite_fallback' is now always touched under therelevant lock, we can drop the ONCE annotation on write.",
