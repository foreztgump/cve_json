    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:nfsd: Initialize ssc before laundromat_work to prevent NULL dereferenceIn nfs4_state_start_net(), laundromat_work may access nfsd_ssc throughnfs4_laundromat -> nfsd4_ssc_expire_umount. If nfsd_ssc isn't initialized,this can cause NULL pointer dereference.Normally the delayed start of laundromat_work allows sufficient time fornfsd_ssc initialization to complete. However, when the kernel waits toolong for userspace responses (e.g. in nfs4_state_start_net ->nfsd4_end_grace -> nfsd4_record_grace_done -> nfsd4_cld_grace_done ->cld_pipe_upcall -> __cld_pipe_upcall -> wait_for_completion path), thedelayed work may start before nfsd_ssc initialization finishes.Fix this by moving nfsd_ssc initialization before starting laundromat_work.",
