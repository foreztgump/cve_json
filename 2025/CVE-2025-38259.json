    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ASoC: codecs: wcd9335: Fix missing free of regulator suppliesDriver gets and enables all regulator supplies in probe path(wcd9335_parse_dt() and wcd9335_power_on_reset()), but does not cleanupin final error paths and in unbind (missing remove() callback).  Thisleads to leaked memory and unbalanced regulator enable count duringprobe errors or unbind.Fix this by converting entire code into devm_regulator_bulk_get_enable()which also greatly simplifies the code.",
