    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/radeon: fix uninitialized size issue in radeon_vce_cs_parse()On the off chance that command stream passed from userspace viaioctl() call to radeon_vce_cs_parse() is weirdly crafted andfirst command to execute is to encode (case 0x03000001), the functionin question will attempt to call radeon_vce_cs_reloc() with sizeargument that has not been properly initialized. Specifically, 'size'will point to 'tmp' variable before the latter had a chance to beassigned any value.Play it safe and init 'tmp' with 0, thus ensuring thatradeon_vce_cs_reloc() will catch an early error in cases like these.Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with staticanalysis tool SVACE.(cherry picked from commit 2d52de55f9ee7aaee0e09ac443f77855989c6b68)",
