        "CWE-674 Uncontrolled Recursion"
    ],
    "description": "Poppler 24.06.1 through 25.x before 25.04.0 allows stack consumption and a SIGSEGV via deeply nested structures within the metadata (such as GTS_PDFEVersion) of a PDF document, e.g., a regular expression for a long pdfsubver string. This occurs in Dict::lookup, Catalog::getMetadata, and associated functions in PDFDoc, with deep recursion in the regex executor (std::__detail::_Executor).",
