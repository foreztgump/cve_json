    "id": "CVE-2025-26466",
    "product": "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 10",
    "version": "n/a",
    "vulnerability": [
        "Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling"
    ],
    "description": "A flaw was found in the OpenSSH package. For each ping packet the SSH server receives, a pong packet is allocated in a memory buffer and stored in a queue of packages. It is only freed when the server/client key exchange has finished. A malicious client may keep sending such packages, leading to an uncontrolled increase in memory consumption on the server side. Consequently, the server may become unavailable, resulting in a denial of service attack.",
