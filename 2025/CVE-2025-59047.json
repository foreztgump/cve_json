        "CWE-682: Incorrect Calculation"
    ],
    "description": "matrix-sdk-base is the base component to build a Matrix client library. In matrix-sdk-base before 0.14.1, calling the `RoomMember::normalized_power_level()` method can cause a panic if a room member has a power level of `Int::Min`. The issue is fixed in matrix-sdk-base 0.14.1. The affected method isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t used internally, so avoiding calling `RoomMember::normalized_power_level()` prevents the panic.",
