    "description": "A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the coap_delete_pdu_lkd function within coap_pdu.c of the libcoap library. This issue occurs due to improper handling of memory after the freeing of a PDU object, leading to potential memory corruption or the possibility of executing arbitrary code. NOTE: this is disputed by the Supplier because it only occurs when an application uses libcoap incorrectly.",
