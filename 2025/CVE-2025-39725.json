    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm/vmscan: fix hwpoisoned large folio handling in shrink_folio_listIn shrink_folio_list(), the hwpoisoned folio may be large folio, whichcan't be handled by unmap_poisoned_folio().  For THP, try_to_unmap_one()must be passed with TTU_SPLIT_HUGE_PMD to split huge PMD first and thenretry.  Without TTU_SPLIT_HUGE_PMD, we will trigger null-ptr deref ofpvmw.pte.  Even we passed TTU_SPLIT_HUGE_PMD, we will trigger aWARN_ON_ONCE due to the page isn't in swapcache.Since UCE is rare in real world, and race with reclaimation is more rare,just skipping the hwpoisoned large folio is enough.  memory_failure() willhandle it if the UCE is triggered again.This happens when memory reclaim for large folio races withmemory_failure(), and will lead to kernel panic.  The race is asfollows:cpu0      cpu1 shrink_folio_list memory_failure  TestSetPageHWPoison  unmap_poisoned_folio  --> trigger BUG_ON due to  unmap_poisoned_folio couldn't   handle large folio[tujinjiang@huawei.com: add comment to unmap_poisoned_folio()]",
