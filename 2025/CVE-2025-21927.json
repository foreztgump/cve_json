    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:nvme-tcp: fix potential memory corruption in nvme_tcp_recv_pdu()nvme_tcp_recv_pdu() doesn't check the validity of the header length.When header digests are enabled, a target might send a packet with aninvalid header length (e.g. 255), causing nvme_tcp_verify_hdgst()to access memory outside the allocated area and cause memory corruptionsby overwriting it with the calculated digest.Fix this by rejecting packets with an unexpected header length.",
