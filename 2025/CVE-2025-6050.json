    "description": "Mezzanine CMS, in versions prior to 6.1.1, contains a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the admin interface. The vulnerability exists in the \"displayable_links_js\" function, which fails to properly sanitize blog post titles before including them in JSON responses served via \"/admin/displayable_links.js\". An authenticated admin user can create a blog post with a malicious JavaScript payload in the title field, then trick another admin user into clicking a direct link to the \"/admin/displayable_links.js\" endpoint, causing the malicious script to execute in their browser.",
