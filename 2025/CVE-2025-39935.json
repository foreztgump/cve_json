    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ASoC: codec: sma1307: Fix memory corruption in sma1307_setting_loaded()The sma1307->set.header_size is how many integers are in the header(there are 8 of them) but instead of allocating space of 8 integerswe allocate 8 bytes.  This leads to memory corruption when we copy datait on the next line:        memcpy(sma1307->set.header, data,               sma1307->set.header_size * sizeof(int));Also since we're immediately copying over the memory in ->set.header,there is no need to zero it in the allocator.  Use devm_kmalloc_array()to allocate the memory instead.",
