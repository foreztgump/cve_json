    ],
    "description": "Astro is a web framework that includes an image proxy. In versions 5.13.4 and later before 5.13.10, the image proxy domain validation can be bypassed by using backslashes in the href parameter, allowing server-side requests to arbitrary URLs. This can lead to server-side request forgery (SSRF) and potentially cross-site scripting (XSS). This vulnerability exists due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2025-58179. Fixed in 5.13.10.",
