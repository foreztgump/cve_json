    "description": "Flag Forge is a Capture The Flag (CTF) platform. In versions from 2.2.0 to before 2.3.1, the FlagForge web application improperly handles session invalidation. Authenticated users can continue to access protected endpoints, such as /api/profile, even after logging out. CSRF tokens are also still valid post-logout, which can allow unauthorized actions. This issue has been patched in version 2.3.1.",
