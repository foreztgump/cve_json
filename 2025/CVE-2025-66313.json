    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')"
    ],
    "description": "ChurchCRM is an open-source church management system. In ChurchCRM 6.2.0 and earlier, there is a time-based blind SQL injection in the handling of the 1FieldSec parameter. Injecting SLEEP() causes deterministic server-side delays, proving the value is incorporated into a SQL query without proper parameterization. The issue allows data exfiltration and modification via blind techniques.",
