    "description": "VMware ESXi,\u00a0Workstation, and Fusion\u00a0contain an integer-underflow in VMCI (Virtual Machine Communication Interface) that leads to an out-of-bounds write.\u00a0A malicious actor with local administrative privileges on a virtual machine may exploit this issue to execute code as the virtual machine's VMX process running on the host. On ESXi, the exploitation is contained within the VMX sandbox whereas, on Workstation and Fusion, this may lead to code execution on the machine where Workstation or Fusion is installed.",
