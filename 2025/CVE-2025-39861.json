    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:Bluetooth: vhci: Prevent use-after-free by removing debugfs files earlyMove the creation of debugfs files into a dedicated function, and ensurethey are explicitly removed during vhci_release(), before associateddata structures are freed.Previously, debugfs files such as \"force_suspend\", \"force_wakeup\", andothers were created under hdev->debugfs but not removed invhci_release(). Since vhci_release() frees the backing vhci_datastructure, any access to these files after release would result inuse-after-free errors.Although hdev->debugfs is later freed in hci_release_dev(), user canaccess files after vhci_data is freed but before hdev->debugfs isreleased.",
