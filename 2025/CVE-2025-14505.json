    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation"
    ],
    "description": "The ECDSA implementation of the Elliptic package generates incorrect signatures if an interim value of 'k' (as computed based on step 3.2 of  RFC 6979 https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6979 ) has leading zeros and is susceptible to cryptanalysis, which can lead to secret key exposure. This happens, because the byte-length of 'k' is incorrectly computed, resulting in its getting truncated during the computation. Legitimate transactions or communications will be broken as a result.\u00a0Furthermore, due to the nature of the fault, attackers could\u2013under certain conditions\u2013derive the secret key, if they could get their hands on both a faulty signature generated by a vulnerable version of Elliptic and a correct signature for the same inputs.This issue affects all known versions of Elliptic (at the time of writing, versions less than or equal to 6.6.1).",
