    "description": "Traefik (pronounced traffic) is an HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer. Prior to versions 2.11.25 and 3.4.1, there is a potential vulnerability in Traefik managing the requests using a PathPrefix, Path or PathRegex matcher. When Traefik is configured to route the requests to a backend using a matcher based on the path, if the URL contains a URL encoded string in its path, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible to target a backend, exposed using another router, by-passing the middlewares chain. This issue has been patched in versions 2.11.25 and 3.4.1.",
