    "description": "Newforma Info Exchange (NIX) '/UserWeb/Common/UploadBlueimp.ashx' allows an authenticated attacker to upload an arbitrary file to any location writable by the NIX application. An attacker can upload and run a web shell or other content executable by the web server. An attacker can also delete directories.  In Newforma before 2023.1, anonymous access is enabled by default (CVE-2025-35062), allowing an otherwise unauthenticated attacker to effectively authenticate as 'anonymous' and exploit this file upload vulnerability.",
