        "CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"
    ],
    "description": "Stirling-PDF is a locally hosted web application that performs various operations on PDF files. Prior to version 1.1.0, when using the /api/v1/convert/html/pdf endpoint to convert HTML to PDF, the backend calls a third-party tool to process it and includes a sanitizer for security sanitization which can be bypassed and result in SSRF. This issue has been patched in version 1.1.0.",
