    "description": "An issue was discovered in Shopizer 3.2.7. The server's CORS implementation reflects the client-supplied Origin header verbatim into Access-Control-Allow-Origin without any whitelist validation, while also enabling Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true. This allows any malicious origin to make authenticated cross-origin requests and read sensitive responses.",
