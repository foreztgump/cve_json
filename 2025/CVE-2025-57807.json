    "version": "< 14.8.2 ",
    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow",
        "CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size",
        "CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write"
    ],
    "description": "ImageMagick is free and open-source software used for editing and manipulating digital images. ImageMagick versions lower than 14.8.2 include  insecure functions: SeekBlob(), which permits advancing the stream offset beyond the current end without increasing capacity, and WriteBlob(), which then expands by quantum + length (amortized) instead of offset + length, and copies to data + offset. When offset \u226b extent, the copy targets memory beyond the allocation, producing a deterministic heap write on 64-bit builds. No 2\u2076\u2074 arithmetic wrap, external delegates, or policy settings are required. This is fixed in version 14.8.2.",
