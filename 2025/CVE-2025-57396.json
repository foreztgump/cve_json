    "description": "Tandoor Recipes 2.0.0-alpha-1, fixed in 2.0.0-alpha-2, is vulnerable to privilege escalation. This is due to the rework of the API, which resulted in the User Profile API Endpoint containing two boolean values indicating whether a user is staff or administrative. Consequently, any user can escalate their privileges to the highest level.",
