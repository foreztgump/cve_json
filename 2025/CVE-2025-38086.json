    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: ch9200: fix uninitialised access during mii_nway_restartIn mii_nway_restart() the code attempts to callmii->mdio_read which is ch9200_mdio_read(). ch9200_mdio_read()utilises a local buffer called \"buff\", which is initialisedwith control_read(). However \"buff\" is conditionallyinitialised inside control_read():        if (err == size) {                memcpy(data, buf, size);        }If the condition of \"err == size\" is not met, then\"buff\" remains uninitialised. Once this happens theuninitialised \"buff\" is accessed and returned duringch9200_mdio_read():        return (buff[0] | buff[1] << 8);The problem stems from the fact that ch9200_mdio_read()ignores the return value of control_read(), leading touinit-access of \"buff\".To fix this we should check the return value ofcontrol_read() and return early on error.",
