    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:parisc: Revise __get_user() to probe user read accessBecause of the way read access support is implemented, read accessinterruptions are only triggered at privilege levels 2 and 3. Thekernel executes at privilege level 0, so __get_user() never triggersa read access interruption (code 26). Thus, it is currently possiblefor user code to access a read protected address via a system call.Fix this by probing read access rights at privilege level 3 (PRIV_USER)and setting __gu_err to -EFAULT (-14) if access isn't allowed.Note the cmpiclr instruction does a 32-bit compare because COND macrodoesn't work inside asm.",
