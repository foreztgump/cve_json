    "description": "vLLM is an inference and serving engine for large language models (LLMs). From 0.1.0 to before 0.10.1.1, a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability can be triggered by sending a single HTTP GET request with an extremely large header to an HTTP endpoint. This results in server memory exhaustion, potentially leading to a crash or unresponsiveness. The attack does not require authentication, making it exploitable by any remote user. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.10.1.1.",
