    ],
    "description": "Multiple Cisco products are affected by a vulnerability in the Snort 3 HTTP Decoder that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the Snort 3 Detection Engine to restart. This vulnerability is due to a lack of complete error checking when the MIME fields of the HTTP header are parsed. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP packets through an established connection to be parsed by Snort 3. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition when the Snort 3 Detection Engine unexpectedly restarts.",
