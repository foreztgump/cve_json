    "description": "Snowflake, a platform for using artificial intelligence in the context of cloud computing, has a vulnerability in the Snowflake JDBC driver (\"Driver\") in versions 3.0.13 through 3.23.0 of the driver. When the logging level was set to DEBUG, the Driver would log locally the client-side encryption master key of the target stage during the execution of GET/PUT commands. This key by itself does not grant access to any sensitive data without additional access authorizations,  and is not logged server-side by Snowflake. Snowflake fixed the issue in version 3.23.1.",
