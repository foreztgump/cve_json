        "CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling"
    ],
    "description": "Axios is a promise based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js. When Axios prior to version 1.11.0 runs on Node.js and is given a URL with the `data:` scheme, it does not perform HTTP. Instead, its Node http adapter decodes the entire payload into memory (`Buffer`/`Blob`) and returns a synthetic 200 response. This path ignores `maxContentLength` / `maxBodyLength` (which only protect HTTP responses), so an attacker can supply a very large `data:` URI and cause the process to allocate unbounded memory and crash (DoS), even if the caller requested `responseType: 'stream'`. Version 1.11.0 contains a patch for the issue.",
