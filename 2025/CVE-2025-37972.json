    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:Input: mtk-pmic-keys - fix possible null pointer dereferenceIn mtk_pmic_keys_probe, the regs parameter is only set if the button isparsed in the device tree. However, on hardware where the button is leftfloating, that node will most likely be removed not to enable thatinput. In that case the code will try to dereference a null pointer.Let's use the regs struct instead as it is defined for all supportedplatforms. Note that it is ok setting the key reg even if that latter isdisabled as the interrupt won't be enabled anyway.",
