    "description": "OpenStack Ironic before 29.0.1 can write unintended files to a target node disk during image handling (if a deployment was performed via the API). A malicious project assigned as a node owner can provide a path to any local file (readable by ironic-conductor), which may then be written to the target node disk. This is difficult to exploit in practice, because a node deployed in this manner should never reach the ACTIVE state, but it still represents a danger in environments running with non-default, insecure configurations such as with automated cleaning disabled. The fixed versions are 24.1.3, 26.1.1, and 29.0.1.",
