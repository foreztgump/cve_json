    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:fs/fhandle.c: fix a race in call of has_locked_children()may_decode_fh() is calling has_locked_children() while holding no locks.That's an oopsable race...The rest of the callers are safe since they are holding namespace_sem andare guaranteed a positive refcount on the mount in question.Rename the current has_locked_children() to __has_locked_children(), makeit static and switch the fs/namespace.c users to it.Make has_locked_children() a wrapper for __has_locked_children(), callingthe latter under read_seqlock_excl(&mount_lock).",
