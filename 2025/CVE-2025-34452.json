    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')",
        "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"
    ],
    "description": "Streama versions 1.10.0 through 1.10.5 and prior to commit b7c8767 contain a\u00c2\u00a0combination of path traversal and server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities in that allow an authenticated attacker to write arbitrary files to the server filesystem. The issue exists in the subtitle download functionality, where user-controlled parameters are used to fetch remote content and construct file paths without proper validation. By supplying a crafted subtitle download URL and a path traversal sequence in the file name, an attacker can write files to arbitrary locations on the server, potentially leading to remote code execution.",
