    "id": "CVE-2025-9905",
    "product": "Keras",
    "version": "3.0.0 ",
    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-913 Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources"
    ],
    "description": "The Keras Model.load_model\u00a0method can be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution, even with safe_mode=True.One can create a specially crafted .h5/.hdf5\u00a0model archive that, when loaded via Model.load_model, will trigger arbitrary code to be executed.This is achieved by crafting a special .h5\u00a0archive file that uses the Lambda\u00a0layer feature of keras which allows arbitrary Python code in the form of pickled code. The vulnerability comes from the fact that the safe_mode=True\u00a0option is not honored when reading .h5\u00a0archives.Note that the .h5/.hdf5\u00a0format is a legacy format supported by Keras 3 for backwards compatibility.",
