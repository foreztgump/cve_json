    ],
    "description": "Vasion Print (formerly PrinterLogic) Virtual Appliance Host versions prior to 1.0.735 and Application prior to 20.0.1330 (macOS/Linux client deployments) contain a vulnerability in the local logging mechanism. Authentication session tokens, including PHPSESSID, XSRF-TOKEN, and laravel_session, are stored in cleartext within world-readable log files. Any local user with access to the machine can extract these session tokens and use them to authenticate remotely to the SaaS environment, bypassing normal login credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized system access and exposure of sensitive information.",
