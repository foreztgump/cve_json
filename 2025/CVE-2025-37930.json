    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/nouveau: Fix WARN_ON in nouveau_fence_context_kill()Nouveau is mostly designed in a way that it's expected that fences onlyever get signaled through nouveau_fence_signal(). However, in at leastone other place, nouveau_fence_done(), can signal fences, too. If thathappens (race) a signaled fence remains in the pending list for a while,until it gets removed by nouveau_fence_update().Should nouveau_fence_context_kill() run in the meantime, this would bea bug because the function would attempt to set an error code on analready signaled fence.Have nouveau_fence_context_kill() check for a fence being signaled.",
