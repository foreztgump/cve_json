    "description": "An issue in System PDV v1.0 allows a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information via the hash parameter in a URL. The application contains an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability, which occurs due to a lack of proper authorization checks when accessing objects referenced by this parameter. This allows direct access to other users' data or internal resources without proper permission. Successful exploitation of this flaw may result in the exposure of sensitive information.",
