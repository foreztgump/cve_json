    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ipv6: prevent infinite loop in rt6_nlmsg_size()While testing prior patch, I was able to triggeran infinite loop in rt6_nlmsg_size() in the following place:list_for_each_entry_rcu(sibling, &f6i->fib6_siblings,\t\t\tfib6_siblings) {\trt6_nh_nlmsg_size(sibling->fib6_nh, &nexthop_len);}This is because fib6_del_route() and fib6_add_rt2node()uses list_del_rcu(), which can confuse rcu readers,because they might no longer see the head of the list.Restart the loop if f6i->fib6_nsiblings is zero.",
