        "CWE-285: Improper Authorization"
    ],
    "description": "In Juju versions prior to 3.6.8 and 2.9.52, any authenticated controller user was allowed to upload arbitrary agent binaries to any model or to the controller itself, without verifying model membership or requiring explicit permissions. This enabled the distribution of poisoned binaries to new or upgraded machines, potentially resulting in remote code execution.",
