    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:LoongArch: Increase ARCH_DMA_MINALIGN up to 16ARCH_DMA_MINALIGN is 1 by default, but some LoongArch-specific devices(such as APBDMA) require 16 bytes alignment. When the data buffer lengthis too small, the hardware may make an error writing cacheline. Thus, itis dangerous to allocate a small memory buffer for DMA. It's always safeto define ARCH_DMA_MINALIGN as L1_CACHE_BYTES but unnecessary (kmalloc()need small memory objects). Therefore, just increase it to 16.",
