        "NULL Pointer Dereference"
    ],
    "description": "A NULL pointer dereference vulnerability exists in FFmpeg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Firequalizer filter (libavfilter/af_firequalizer.c) due to a missing check on the return value of av_malloc_array() in the config_input() function. An attacker could exploit this by tricking a victim into processing a crafted media file with the Firequalizer filter enabled, causing the application to dereference a NULL pointer and crash, leading to denial of service.",
