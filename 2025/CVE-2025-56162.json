    "description": "YOSHOP 2.0 suffers from an unauthenticated SQL injection in the goodsIds parameter of the /api/goods/listByIds endpoint. The getListByIds function concatenates user input into orderRaw('field(goods_id, ...)'), allowing attackers to: (a) enumerate or modify database data, including dumping admin password hashes; (b) write web-shell files or invoke xp_cmdshell, leading to remote code execution on servers configured with sufficient DB privileges.",
