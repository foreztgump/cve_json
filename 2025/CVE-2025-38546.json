    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:atm: clip: Fix memory leak of struct clip_vcc.ioctl(ATMARP_MKIP) allocates struct clip_vcc and set it tovcc->user_back.The code assumes that vcc_destroy_socket() passes NULL skbto vcc->push() when the socket is close()d, and then clip_push()frees clip_vcc.However, ioctl(ATMARPD_CTRL) sets NULL to vcc->push() inatm_init_atmarp(), resulting in memory leak.Let's serialise two ioctl() by lock_sock() and check vcc->push()in atm_init_atmarp() to prevent memleak.",
