        "CWE-285: Improper Authorization"
    ],
    "description": "AutoGPT is a platform that allows users to create, deploy, and manage continuous artificial intelligence agents. In v0.6.15 and below, the external API's get_graph_execution_results endpoint has an authorization bypass vulnerability. While it correctly validates user access to the graph_id, it fails to verify ownership of the graph_exec_id parameter, allowing authenticated users to access any execution results by providing arbitrary execution IDs. The internal API implements proper validation for both parameters. This is fixed in v0.6.16.",
