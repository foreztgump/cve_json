    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:f2fs: fix KMSAN uninit-value in extent_info usageKMSAN reported a use of uninitialized value in `__is_extent_mergeable()` and `__is_back_mergeable()` via the read extent tree path.The root cause is that `get_read_extent_info()` only initializes threefields (`fofs`, `blk`, `len`) of `struct extent_info`, leaving theremaining fields uninitialized. This leads to undefined behaviorwhen those fields are accessed later, especially duringextent merging.Fix it by zero-initializing the `extent_info` struct before population.",
