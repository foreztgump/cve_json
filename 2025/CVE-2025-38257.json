    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:s390/pkey: Prevent overflow in size calculation for memdup_user()Number of apqn target list entries contained in 'nr_apqns' variable isdetermined by userspace via an ioctl call so the result of the product incalculation of size passed to memdup_user() may overflow.In this case the actual size of the allocated area and the valuedescribing it won't be in sync leading to various types of unpredictablebehaviour later.Use a proper memdup_array_user() helper which returns an error if anoverflow is detected. Note that it is different from when nr_apqns isinitially zero - that case is considered valid and should be handled insubsequent pkey_handler implementations.Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org).",
