        "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
    ],
    "description": "A Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability has been identified in the KnowledgeBaseWebReader class of the run-llama/llama_index project, affecting version ~ latest(v0.12.15). The vulnerability arises due to inappropriate secure coding measures, specifically the lack of proper implementation of the max_depth parameter in the get_article_urls function. This allows an attacker to exhaust Python's recursion limit through repeated function calls, leading to resource consumption and ultimately crashing the Python process.",
