        "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation",
        "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function",
        "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')",

    ],
    "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in CryptoLog (PHP version, discontinued since 2009) due to a chained exploitation of SQL injection and command injection vulnerabilities. An unauthenticated attacker can gain shell access as the web server user by first exploiting a SQL injection flaw in login.php to bypass authentication, followed by command injection in logshares_ajax.php to execute arbitrary operating system commands.The login bypass is achieved by submitting crafted SQL via the user POST parameter. Once authenticated, the attacker can abuse the lsid POST parameter in the logshares_ajax.php endpoint to inject and execute a command using $(...) syntax, resulting in code execution under the web context.This exploitation path does not exist in the ASP.NET version of CryptoLog released since 2009.",
