    "description": "A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the SourceCodester Client Database Management System 1.0 allows an attacker to cause an authenticated administrative user to perform user deletion actions without their consent. The application's user deletion endpoint (e.g., superadmin_user_delete.php) accepts POST requests containing a user_id parameter and does not enforce request origin or anti-CSRF tokens. Because the endpoint lacks proper authentication/authorization checks and CSRF protections, a remote attacker can craft a malicious page that triggers deletion when visited by an authenticated admin, resulting in arbitrary removal of user accounts.",
