After process abort exit, user queuesstill use the GPU to access system memory before h/w is reset while KFDcleanup worker free system memory and free VRAM.There is use-after-free race bug that KFD allocate and reuse the freedsystem memory, and user queue write to the same system memory to corruptthe data structure and cause driver crash.To fix this race, KFD cleanup worker terminate user queues, then flushreset_domain wq to wait for any GPU ongoing reset complete, and thenfree outstanding BOs.",
