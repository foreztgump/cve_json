    "description": "Vasion Print (formerly PrinterLogic) Virtual Appliance Host versions prior to 22.0.951, Application prior to 20.0.2368 (VA and SaaS deployments) contain an undocumented local user account named ubuntu with a preset password and a sudoers entry granting that account passwordless root privileges (ubuntu ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL). Anyone who knows the hardcoded password can obtain root privileges via local console or equivalent administrative access, enabling local privilege escalation. NOTE: The patch for this vulnerability is reported to be incomplete:\u00c2\u00a0/etc/shadow was remediated but /etc/sudoers remains vulnerable.",
