    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:bus: mhi: host: pci_generic: Use pci_try_reset_function() to avoid deadlockThere are multiple places from where the recovery work gets scheduledasynchronously. Also, there are multiple places where the caller waitssynchronously for the recovery to be completed. One such place is duringthe PM shutdown() callback.If the device is not alive during recovery_work, it will try to reset thedevice using pci_reset_function(). This function internally will take thedevice_lock() first before resetting the device. By this time, if the lockhas already been acquired, then recovery_work will get stalled whilewaiting for the lock. And if the lock was already acquired by the callerwhich waits for the recovery_work to be completed, it will lead todeadlock.This is what happened on the X1E80100 CRD device when the device diedbefore shutdown() callback. Driver core calls the driver's shutdown()callback while holding the device_lock() leading to deadlock.And this deadlock scenario can occur on other paths as well, like duringthe PM suspend() callback, where the driver core would hold thedevice_lock() before calling driver's suspend() callback. And if therecovery_work was already started, it could lead to deadlock. This is alsoobserved on the X1E80100 CRD.So to fix both issues, use pci_try_reset_function() in recovery_work. Thisfunction first checks for the availability of the device_lock() beforetrying to reset the device. If the lock is available, it will acquire itand reset the device. Otherwise, it will return -EAGAIN. If that happens,recovery_work will fail with the error message \"Recovery failed\" as notmuch could be done.",
