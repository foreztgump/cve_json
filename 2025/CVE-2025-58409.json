        "CWE - CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (4.18)"
    ],
    "description": "Software installed and run as a non-privileged user may conduct improper GPU system calls to subvert GPU HW to write to arbitrary physical memory pages.Under certain circumstances this exploit could be used to corrupt data pages not allocated by the GPU driver but memory pages in use by the kernel and drivers running on the platform altering their behaviour.This attack can lead the GPU to perform write operations on restricted internal GPU buffers that can lead to a second order affect of corrupted arbitrary physical memory.",
