    "version": "< 1.10.19 ",
    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')"
    ],
    "description": "HTTP.jl is an HTTP client and server functionality for the Julia programming language. Prior to version 1.10.19, HTTP.jl did not validate header names/values for illegal characters, allowing CRLF-based header injection and response splitting. This enables HTTP response splitting and header injection, leading to cache poisoning, XSS, session fixation, and more. This issue is fixed in HTTP.jl  `v1.10.19`.",
