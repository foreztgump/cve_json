        "CWE-130: Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency"
    ],
    "description": "A vulnerability has been identified in TeleControl Server Basic (All versions < V3.1.2.2). The affected product does not properly validate a length field in a serialized message which it uses to determine the amount of memory to be allocated for deserialization. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause the application to allocate exhaustive amounts of memory and subsequently create a partial denial of service condition.\nSuccessful exploitation is only possible in redundant Telecontrol Server Basic setups and only if the connection between the redundant servers has been disrupted.",
