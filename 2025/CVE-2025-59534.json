        "CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')"
    ],
    "description": "CryptoLib provides a software-only solution using the CCSDS Space Data Link Security Protocol - Extended Procedures (SDLS-EP) to secure communications between a spacecraft running the core Flight System (cFS) and a ground station. Prior to version 1.4.2, there is a command Injection vulnerability in initialize_kerberos_keytab_file_login(). The vulnerability exists because the code directly interpolates user-controlled input into a shell command and executes it via system() without any sanitization or validation. This issue has been patched in version 1.4.2.",
