    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/mdiobus: Fix potential out-of-bounds read/write accessWhen using publicly available tools like 'mdio-tools' to read/write datafrom/to network interface and its PHY via mdiobus, there is no verification ofparameters passed to the ioctl and it accepts any mdio address.Currently there is support for 32 addresses in kernel via PHY_MAX_ADDR define,but it is possible to pass higher value than that via ioctl.While read/write operation should generally fail in this case,mdiobus provides stats array, where wrong address may allow out-of-boundsread/write.Fix that by adding address verification before read/write operation.While this excludes this access from any statistics, it improves security ofread/write operation.",
