    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:hisi_acc_vfio_pci: fix XQE dma address errorThe dma addresses of EQE and AEQE are wrong after migration andresults in guest kernel-mode encryption services  failure.Comparing the definition of hardware registers, we found thatthere was an error when the data read from the register wascombined into an address. Therefore, the address combinationsequence needs to be corrected.Even after fixing the above problem, we still have an issuewhere the Guest from an old kernel can get migrated tonew kernel and may result in wrong data.In order to ensure that the address is correct after migration,if an old magic number is detected, the dma address needs to beupdated.",
