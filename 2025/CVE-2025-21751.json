    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/mlx5: HWS, change error flow on matcher disconnectCurrently, when firmware failure occurs during matcher disconnect flow,the error flow of the function reconnects the matcher back and returnsan error, which continues running the calling function and eventuallyfrees the matcher that is being disconnected.This leads to a case where we have a freed matcher on the matchers list,which in turn leads to use-after-free and eventual crash.This patch fixes that by not trying to reconnect the matcher back whensome FW command fails during disconnect.Note that we're dealing here with FW error. We can't overcome thisproblem. This might lead to bad steering state (e.g. wrong connectionbetween matchers), and will also lead to resource leakage, as it isthe case with any other error handling during resource destruction.However, the goal here is to allow the driver to continue and not crashthe machine with use-after-free error.",
