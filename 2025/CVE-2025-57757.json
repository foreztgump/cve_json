In versions starting from 5.0.0 and prior to 5.3.38 and 5.6.1, if a news feed contains protected news archives, their news items are not filtered and become publicly available in the RSS feed. This issue has been patched in versions 5.3.38 and 5.6.1. A workaround involves not adding protected news archives to the news feed page.",
