    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm/damon/lru_sort: avoid divide-by-zero in damon_lru_sort_apply_parameters()Patch series \"mm/damon: avoid divide-by-zero in DAMON module's parametersapplication\".DAMON's RECLAIM and LRU_SORT modules perform no validation onuser-configured parameters during application, which may lead todivision-by-zero errors.Avoid the divide-by-zero by adding validation checks when DAMON modulesattempt to apply the parameters.This patch (of 2):During the calculation of 'hot_thres' and 'cold_thres', either'sample_interval' or 'aggr_interval' is used as the divisor, which maylead to division-by-zero errors.  Fix it by directly returning -EINVALwhen such a case occurs.  Additionally, since 'aggr_interval' is alreadyrequired to be set no smaller than 'sample_interval' in damon_set_attrs(),only the case where 'sample_interval' is zero needs to be checked.",
