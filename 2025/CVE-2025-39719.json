    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:iio: imu: bno055: fix OOB access of hw_xlate arrayFix a potential out-of-bounds array access of the hw_xlate array inbno055.c.In bno055_get_regmask(), hw_xlate was iterated over the length of thevals array instead of the length of the hw_xlate array. In the case ofbno055_gyr_scale, the vals array is larger than the hw_xlate array,so this could result in an out-of-bounds access. In practice, thisshouldn't happen though because a match should always be found whichbreaks out of the for loop before it iterates beyond the end of thehw_xlate array.By adding a new hw_xlate_len field to the bno055_sysfs_attr, we can besure we are iterating over the correct length.",
