    "description": "CNCF Harbor 2.13.x before 2.13.1 and 2.12.x before 2.12.4 allows information disclosure by administrators who can exploit an ORM Leak present in the /api/v2.0/users endpoint to leak users' password hash and salt values. The q URL parameter allows a user to filter users by any column, and filter password=~ could be abused to leak out a user's password hash character by character. An attacker with administrator access could exploit this to leak highly sensitive information stored in the Harbor database. All endpoints that support the q URL parameter are vulnerable to this ORM leak attack.",
