    "description": "A Host header injection vulnerability exists in CTFd 3.7.5, due to the application failing to properly validate or sanitize the Host header. An attacker can manipulate the Host header in HTTP requests, which may lead to phishing attacks, reset password, or cache poisoning. NOTE: the Supplier's position is that the end user is supposed to edit the NGINX configuration template to set server_name (with this setting, Host header injection cannot occur).",
