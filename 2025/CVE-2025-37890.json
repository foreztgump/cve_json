    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net_sched: hfsc: Fix a UAF vulnerability in class with netem as child qdiscAs described in Gerrard's report [1], we have a UAF case when an hfsc classhas a netem child qdisc. The crux of the issue is that hfsc is assumingthat checking for cl->qdisc->q.qlen == 0 guarantees that it hasn't insertedthe class in the vttree or eltree (which is not true for the netemduplicate case).This patch checks the n_active class variable to make sure that the codewon't insert the class in the vttree or eltree twice, catering for thereentrant case.[1] https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/CAHcdcOm+03OD2j6R0=YHKqmy=VgJ8xEOKuP6c7mSgnp-TEJJbw@mail.gmail.com/",
