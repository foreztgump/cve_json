    "description": "Vasion Print (formerly PrinterLogic) Virtual Appliance Host and Application (VA and SaaS deployments) mount host configuration and secret material under /var/www/efs_storage into many Docker containers with overly-permissive filesystem permissions. Files such as secrets.env, GPG-encrypted blobs in .secrets, MySQL client keys, and application session files are accessible from multiple containers. An attacker who controls or reaches any container can read or modify these artifacts, leading to credential theft, RCE via Laravel APP_KEY, Portainer takeover, and full compromise.",
