        "n/a"
    ],
    "description": "In SQLite 3.44.0 through 3.49.0 before 3.49.1, the concat_ws() SQL function can cause memory to be written beyond the end of a malloc-allocated buffer. If the separator argument is attacker-controlled and has a large string (e.g., 2MB or more), an integer overflow occurs in calculating the size of the result buffer, and thus malloc may not allocate enough memory.",
