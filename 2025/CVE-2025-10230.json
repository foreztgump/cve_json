    "vulnerability": [
        "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')"
    ],
    "description": "A flaw was found in Samba, in the front-end WINS hook handling: NetBIOS names from registration packets are passed to a shell without proper validation or escaping. Unsanitized NetBIOS name data from WINS registration packets are inserted into a shell command and executed by the Samba Active Directory Domain Controller\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wins hook, allowing an unauthenticated network attacker to achieve remote command execution as the Samba process.",
