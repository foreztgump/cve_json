        "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
    ],
    "description": "The Ally \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Web Accessibility & Usability plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.8.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the enable_unfiltered_files_upload function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to enable unfiltered file upload and add svg files to the upload list via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
