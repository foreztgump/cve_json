    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:gpiolib: acpi: initialize acpi_gpio_info structSince commit 7c010d463372 (\"gpiolib: acpi: Make sure we fill structacpi_gpio_info\"), uninitialized acpi_gpio_info struct are passed to__acpi_find_gpio() and later in the call stack info->quirks is used inacpi_populate_gpio_lookup. This breaks the i2c_hid_cpi driver:[   58.122916] i2c_hid_acpi i2c-UNIW0001:00: HID over i2c has not been provided an Int IRQ[   58.123097] i2c_hid_acpi i2c-UNIW0001:00: probe with driver i2c_hid_acpi failed with error -22Fix this by initializing the acpi_gpio_info pass to __acpi_find_gpio()",
