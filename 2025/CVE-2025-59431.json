    "description": "MapServer is a system for developing web-based GIS applications. Prior to 8.4.1, the XML Filter Query directive PropertyName is vulnerably to Boolean-based SQL injection. It seems like expression checking is bypassed by introducing double quote characters in the PropertyName. Allowing to manipulate backend database queries. This vulnerability is fixed in 8.4.1.",
