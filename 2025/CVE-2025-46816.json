    "description": "goshs is a SimpleHTTPServer written in Go. Starting in version 0.3.4 and prior to version 1.0.5, running goshs without arguments makes it possible for anyone to execute commands on the server. The function `dispatchReadPump` does not checks the option cli `-c`, thus allowing anyone to execute arbitrary command through the use of websockets. Version 1.0.5 fixes the issue.",
