    "description": "aiomysql is a library for accessing a MySQL database from the asyncio. Prior to version 0.3.0, the client-side settings are not checked before sending local files to MySQL server, which allows obtaining arbitrary files from the client using a rogue server. It is possible to create a rogue MySQL server that emulates authorization, ignores client flags and requests arbitrary files from the client by sending a LOAD_LOCAL instruction packet. This issue has been patched in version 0.3.0.",
