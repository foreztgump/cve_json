        "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
    ],
    "description": "ZenML version 0.83.1 is affected by a path traversal vulnerability in the `PathMaterializer` class. The `load` function uses `is_path_within_directory` to validate files during `data.tar.gz` extraction, which fails to effectively detect symbolic and hard links. This vulnerability can lead to arbitrary file writes, potentially resulting in arbitrary command execution if critical files are overwritten.",
