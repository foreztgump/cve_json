    "product": "Access Manager 92xx-k5",
    "version": "92xx-K5: All Versions ",
    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-1188: Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default",
        "CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function"
    ],
    "description": "The exos 9300 application can be used to configure Access Managers (e.g. 92xx, 9230 and 9290). The configuration is done in a graphical user interface on the dormakaba exos server. As soon as the save button is clicked in exos 9300, the whole configuration is sent to the selected Access Manager via SOAP. The SOAP request is sent without any prior authentication or authorization by default. Though authentication and authorization can be configured using IPsec for 92xx-K5 devices and mTLS for 92xx-K7 devices, it is not enabled by default and must therefore be activated with additional steps.This insecure default allows an attacker with network level access to completely control the whole environment. An attacker is for example easily able to conduct the following tasks without prior authentication:- Re-configure Access Managers (e.g. remove alarming system requirements)- Freely re-configure the inputs and outputs- Open all connected doors permanently- Open all doors for a defined time interval- Change the admin password- and many moreNetwork level access can be gained due to an insufficient network segmentation as well as missing LAN firewalls. Devices with an insecure configuration have been identified to be directly exposed to the internet.",
