    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:iommu/mediatek: Fix NULL pointer deference in mtk_iommu_device_groupCurrently, mtk_iommu calls during probe iommu_device_register beforethe hw_list from driver data is initialized. Since iommu probing issuefix, it leads to NULL pointer dereference in mtk_iommu_device_group whenhw_list is accessed with list_first_entry (not null safe).So, change the call order to ensure iommu_device_register is calledafter the driver data are initialized.",
