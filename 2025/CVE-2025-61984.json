    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-159 Improper Handling of Invalid Use of Special Elements"
    ],
    "description": "ssh in OpenSSH before 10.1 allows control characters in usernames that originate from certain possibly untrusted sources, potentially leading to code execution when a ProxyCommand is used. The untrusted sources are the command line and %-sequence expansion of a configuration file. (A configuration file that provides a complete literal username is not categorized as an untrusted source.)",
