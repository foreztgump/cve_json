    "description": "The Positron PX360BT SW REV 8 car alarm system is vulnerable to a replay attack due to a failure in implementing rolling code security. The alarm system does not properly rotate or invalidate used codes, allowing repeated reuse of captured transmissions. This exposes users to significant security risks, including vehicle theft and loss of trust in the alarm's anti-cloning claims.",
