    "description": "DLL hijacking vulnerability in Evope Collector 1.1.6.9.0 and related components load the wtsapi32.dll library from an uncontrolled search path (C:\\ProgramData\\Evope). This allows local unprivileged attackers to execute arbitrary code or escalate privileges to SYSTEM by placing a crafted DLL in that location. The vulnerable component is Evope.Service.exe, which runs with SYSTEM privileges and automatically loads the DLL on startup or reboot.",
