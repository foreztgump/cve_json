    "description": "TRUfusion Enterprise through 7.10.4.0 uses the /trufusionPortal/fileupload endpoint to upload files. However, the application doesn't properly sanitize the input to this endpoint, ultimately allowing path traversal sequences to be included. This can be used to write to any filename with any file type at any location on the local server, ultimately allowing execution of arbitrary code.",
