    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:powercap: dtpm_cpu: Fix NULL pointer dereference in get_pd_power_uw()The get_pd_power_uw() function can crash with a NULL pointer dereferencewhen em_cpu_get() returns NULL. This occurs when a CPU becomes impossibleduring runtime, causing get_cpu_device() to return NULL, which propagatesthrough em_cpu_get() and leads to a crash when em_span_cpus() dereferencesthe NULL pointer.Add a NULL check after em_cpu_get() and return 0 if unavailable,matching the existing fallback behavior in __dtpm_cpu_setup().[ rjw: Drop an excess empty code line ]",
