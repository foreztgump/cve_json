    "description": "Omni manages Kubernetes on bare metal, virtual machines, or in a cloud. Prior to 1.1.5 and 1.0.2, there is a nil pointer dereference vulnerability in the Omni Resource Service allows unauthenticated users to cause a server panic and denial of service by sending empty create/update resource requests through the API endpoints. The vulnerability exists in the isSensitiveSpec function which calls grpcomni.CreateResource without checking if the resource's metadata field is nil. When a resource is created with an empty Metadata field, the CreateResource function attempts to access resource.Metadata.Version causing a segmentation fault. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.1.5 and 1.0.2.",
