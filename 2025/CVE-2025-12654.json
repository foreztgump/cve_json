    "description": "The Migration, Backup, Staging \u00e2\u20ac\u201c WPvivid Backup & Migration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary directory creation in all versions up to, and including, 0.9.120. This is due to the check_filesystem_permissions() function not properly restricting the directories that can be created, or in what location. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to create arbitrary directories.",
