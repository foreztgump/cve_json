    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:xen-netfront: handle NULL returned by xdp_convert_buff_to_frame()The function xdp_convert_buff_to_frame() may return NULL if it failsto correctly convert the XDP buffer into an XDP frame due to memoryconstraints, internal errors, or invalid data. Failing to check for NULLmay lead to a NULL pointer dereference if the result is used later inprocessing, potentially causing crashes, data corruption, or undefinedbehavior.On XDP redirect failure, the associated page must be released explicitlyif it was previously retained via get_page(). Failing to do so may resultin a memory leak, as the pages reference count is not decremented.",
