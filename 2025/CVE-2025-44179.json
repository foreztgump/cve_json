    "description": "Hitron CGNF-TWN 3.1.1.43-TWN-pre3 contains a command injection vulnerability in the telnet service. The issue arises due to improper input validation within the telnet command handling mechanism. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by injecting arbitrary commands through the telnet interface when prompted for inputs or commands. Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution (RCE) under the privileges of the telnet user, potentially allowing unauthorized access to system settings and sensitive information.",
