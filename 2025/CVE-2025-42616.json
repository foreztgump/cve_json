        "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
    ],
    "description": "Some endpoints in vulnerability-lookup that modified application state (e.g. changing database entries, user data, configurations, or other privileged actions) may have been accessible via HTTP GET requests without requiring a CSRF token. This flaw leaves the application vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks: an attacker who tricks a logged-in user into visiting a malicious website could cause the user\u2019s browser to issue GET requests that perform unintended state-changing operations in the context of their authenticated session.Because the server would treat these GET requests as valid (since no CSRF protection or POST method enforcement was in place), the attacker could exploit this to escalate privileges, change settings, or carry out other unauthorized actions without needing the user\u2019s explicit consent or awareness.\u00a0The fix ensures that all state-changing endpoints now require HTTP POST requests and include a valid CSRF token. This enforces that state changes cannot be triggered by arbitrary cross-site GET requests.\u00a0This issue affects Vulnerability-Lookup: before 2.18.0.",
