    ],
    "description": "Incus is a system container and virtual machine manager. When using an ACL on a device connected to a bridge, Incus version 6.12 and 6.13 generates nftables rules for local services (DHCP, DNS...) that partially bypass security options `security.mac_filtering`, `security.ipv4_filtering` and `security.ipv6_filtering`. This can lead to DHCP pool exhaustion and opens the door for other attacks. A patch is available at commit 2516fb19ad8428454cb4edfe70c0a5f0dc1da214.",
