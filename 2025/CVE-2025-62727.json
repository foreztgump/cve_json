    ],
    "description": "Starlette is a lightweight ASGI framework/toolkit. Starting in version 0.39.0 and prior to version 0.49.1 , an unauthenticated attacker can send a crafted HTTP Range header that triggers quadratic-time processing in Starlette's FileResponse Range parsing/merging logic. This enables CPU exhaustion per request, causing denial\u2011of\u2011service for endpoints serving files (e.g., StaticFiles or any use of FileResponse). This vulnerability is fixed in 0.49.1.",
