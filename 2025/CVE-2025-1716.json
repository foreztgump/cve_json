    "product": "picklescan",
    "version": "0.0.1<= 0.0.20 ",
    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-184 Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs"
    ],
    "description": "picklescan before 0.0.21 does not treat 'pip' as an unsafe global. An attacker could craft a malicious model that uses Pickle to pull in a malicious PyPI package (hosted, for example, on pypi.org or GitHub) via `pip.main()`. Because pip is not a restricted global, the model, when scanned with picklescan, would pass security checks and appear to be safe, when it could instead prove to be problematic.",
