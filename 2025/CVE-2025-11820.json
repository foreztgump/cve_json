    "description": "The Graphina \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Elementor Charts and Graphs plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via multiple chart widgets in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on data attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. The vulnerability affects multiple chart widgets including Area Chart, Line Chart, Column Chart, Donut Chart, Heatmap Chart, Radar Chart, Polar Chart, Pie Chart, Radial Chart, and Advance Data Table widgets.",
