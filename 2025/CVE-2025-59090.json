    ],
    "description": "On the exos 9300 server, a SOAP API is reachable on port 8002. This API does not require any authentication prior to sending requests. Therefore, network access to the exos server allows e.g. the creation of arbitrary access log events as well as querying the 2FA PINs associated with the enrolled chip cards.",
