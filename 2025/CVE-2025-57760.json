    ],
    "description": "Langflow is a tool for building and deploying AI-powered agents and workflows. A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in Langflow containers where an authenticated user with RCE access can invoke the internal CLI command langflow superuser to create a new administrative user. This results in full superuser access, even if the user initially registered through the UI as a regular (non-admin) account. A patched version has not been made public at this time.",
