    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net_sched: Flush gso_skb list too during ->change()Previously, when reducing a qdisc's limit via the ->change() operation, onlythe main skb queue was trimmed, potentially leaving packets in the gso_skblist. This could result in NULL pointer dereference when we only checksch->limit against sch->q.qlen.This patch introduces a new helper, qdisc_dequeue_internal(), which ensuresboth the gso_skb list and the main queue are properly flushed when trimmingexcess packets. All relevant qdiscs (codel, fq, fq_codel, fq_pie, hhf, pie)are updated to use this helper in their ->change() routines.",
