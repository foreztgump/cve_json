        "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')"
    ],
    "description": "An unauthenticated command injection vulnerability exists in VICIdial versions 2.9 RC1 through 2.13 RC1, within the vicidial_sales_viewer.php component when password encryption is enabled (a non-default configuration). The application improperly passes the HTTP Basic Authentication password directly to a call to exec() without adequate sanitation. This allows remote attackers to inject and execute arbitrary operating system commands as the web server user. NOTE: This vulnerability was mitigated in 2017.",
