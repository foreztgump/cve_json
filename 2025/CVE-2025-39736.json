    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm/kmemleak: avoid deadlock by moving pr_warn() outside kmemleak_lockWhen netpoll is enabled, calling pr_warn_once() while holdingkmemleak_lock in mem_pool_alloc() can cause a deadlock due to lockinversion with the netconsole subsystem.  This occurs becausepr_warn_once() may trigger netpoll, which eventually leads to__alloc_skb() and back into kmemleak code, attempting to reacquirekmemleak_lock.This is the path for the deadlock.mem_pool_alloc()  -> raw_spin_lock_irqsave(&kmemleak_lock, flags);      -> pr_warn_once()          -> netconsole subsystem\t     -> netpoll\t         -> __alloc_skb\t\t   -> __create_object\t\t     -> raw_spin_lock_irqsave(&kmemleak_lock, flags);Fix this by setting a flag and issuing the pr_warn_once() afterkmemleak_lock is released.",
