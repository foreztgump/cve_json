    "description": "Atheos is a self-hosted browser-based cloud IDE. Prior to v602, similar to GHSA-rgjm-6p59-537v/CVE-2025-22152, the `$target` parameter in `/controller.php` was not properly validated, which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary files on the server via path traversal. v602 contains a fix for the issue.",
