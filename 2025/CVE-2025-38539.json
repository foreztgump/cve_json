    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:tracing: Add down_write(trace_event_sem) when adding trace eventWhen a module is loaded, it adds trace events defined by the module. Itmay also need to modify the modules trace printk formats to replace enumnames with their values.If two modules are loaded at the same time, the adding of the event to theftrace_events list can corrupt the walking of the list in the code that ismodifying the printk format strings and crash the kernel.The addition of the event should take the trace_event_sem for write whileit adds the new event.Also add a lockdep_assert_held() on that semaphore in__trace_add_event_dirs() as it iterates the list.",
