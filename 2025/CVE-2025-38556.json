    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:HID: core: Harden s32ton() against conversion to 0 bitsTesting by the syzbot fuzzer showed that the HID core gets ashift-out-of-bounds exception when it tries to convert a 32-bitquantity to a 0-bit quantity.  Ideally this should never occur, butthere are buggy devices and some might have a report field with sizeset to zero; we shouldn't reject the report or the device just becauseof that.Instead, harden the s32ton() routine so that it returns a reasonableresult instead of crashing when it is called with the number of bitsset to 0 -- the same as what snto32() does.",
