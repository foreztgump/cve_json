    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:netem: Update sch->q.qlen before qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog()qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() notifies parent qdisc only if childqdisc becomes empty, therefore we need to reduce the backlog of thechild qdisc before calling it. Otherwise it would miss the opportunityto call cops->qlen_notify(), in the case of DRR, it resulted in UAFsince DRR uses ->qlen_notify() to maintain its active list.",
