    "description": "Improper Neutralization of Escape, Meta, or Control Sequences vulnerability in Apache Tomcat.\u00c2\u00a0For a subset of unlikely rewrite rule configurations, it was possible for a specially crafted request to bypass some rewrite rules. If those rewrite rules effectively enforced security constraints, those constraints could be bypassed.This issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.5, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.39, from 9.0.0.M1 through 9.0.102.The following versions were EOL at the time the CVE was created but are known to be affected: 8.5.0 though 8.5.100. Other, older, EOL versions may also be affected.Users are recommended to upgrade to version [FIXED_VERSION], which fixes the issue.",
