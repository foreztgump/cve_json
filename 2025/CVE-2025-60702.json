    "description": "A command injection vulnerability exists in the TOTOLINK A950RG Router firmware V5.9c.4592_B20191022_ALL within the `system.so` binary. The `setDiagnosisCfg` function retrieves the `ipDoamin` parameter from user input via `websGetVar` and concatenates it directly into a `ping` system command executed via `CsteSystem()` without any sanitization. An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary commands on the device through specially crafted HTTP requests to the router's web interface.",
