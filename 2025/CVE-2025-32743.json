        "CWE-392 Missing Report of Error Condition"
    ],
    "description": "In ConnMan through 1.44, the lookup string in ns_resolv in dnsproxy.c can be NULL or an empty string when the TC (Truncated) bit is set in a DNS response. This allows attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code, because those lookup values lead to incorrect length calculations and incorrect memcpy operations.",
