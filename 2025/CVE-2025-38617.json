    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/packet: fix a race in packet_set_ring() and packet_notifier()When packet_set_ring() releases po->bind_lock, another thread canrun packet_notifier() and process an NETDEV_UP event.This race and the fix are both similar to that of commit 15fe076edea7(\"net/packet: fix a race in packet_bind() and packet_notifier()\").There too the packet_notifier NETDEV_UP event managed to run while apo->bind_lock critical section had to be temporarily released. Andthe fix was similarly to temporarily set po->num to zero to keepthe socket unhooked until the lock is retaken.The po->bind_lock in packet_set_ring and packet_notifier precede theintroduction of git history.",
