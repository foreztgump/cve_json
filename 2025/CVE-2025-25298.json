        "CWE-261: Weak Encoding for Password"
    ],
    "description": "Strapi is an open source headless CMS. The @strapi/core package before version 5.10.3 does not enforce a maximum password length when using bcryptjs for password hashing. Bcryptjs ignores any bytes beyond 72, so passwords longer than 72 bytes are silently truncated. A user can create an account with a password exceeding 72 bytes and later authenticate with only the first 72 bytes. This reduces the effective entropy of overlong passwords and may mislead users who believe characters beyond 72 bytes are required, creating a low likelihood of unintended authentication if an attacker can obtain or guess the truncated portion. Long over\u00e2\u20ac\u2018length inputs can also impose unnecessary processing overhead. The issue is fixed in version 5.10.3. No known workarounds exist.",
