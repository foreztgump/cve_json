    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"
    ],
    "description": "The Responsive Lightbox & Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.5.3 via the 'get_image_size_by_url' function. This is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied URLs when determining image dimensions for gallery items. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to make web requests to arbitrary locations originating from the web application which can be used to query and modify information from internal services.",
