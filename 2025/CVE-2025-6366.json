        "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management"
    ],
    "description": "The Event List plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.4. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's capabilities prior to updating their profile in the el_update_profile() function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to change their capabilities to those of an administrator.",
