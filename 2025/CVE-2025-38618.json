    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:vsock: Do not allow binding to VMADDR_PORT_ANYIt is possible for a vsock to autobind to VMADDR_PORT_ANY. This cancause a use-after-free when a connection is made to the bound socket.The socket returned by accept() also has port VMADDR_PORT_ANY but is noton the list of unbound sockets. Binding it will result in an extrarefcount decrement similar to the one fixed in fcdd2242c023 (vsock: Keepthe binding until socket destruction).Modify the check in __vsock_bind_connectible() to also prevent bindingto VMADDR_PORT_ANY.",
