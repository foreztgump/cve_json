        "CWE-476 NULL Pointer Dereference"
    ],
    "description": "A NULL pointer dereference vulnerability has been identified in the JavaScript library microlight version 0.0.7, a lightweight syntax highlighting library. When processing elements with non-standard CSS color values, the library fails to validate the result of a regular expression match before accessing its properties, leading to an uncaught TypeError and potential application crash. NOTE: this is disputed by multiple parties because there is no common scenario in which an adversary can insert those non-standard values.",
