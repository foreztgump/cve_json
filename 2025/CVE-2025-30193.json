    "product": "DNSdist",
    "version": "",
    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-674 Uncontrolled Recursion"
    ],
    "description": "In some circumstances, when DNSdist is configured to allow an unlimited number of queries on a single, incoming TCP connection from a client, an attacker can cause a denial of service by crafting a TCP exchange that triggers an exhaustion of the stack and a crash of DNSdist, causing a denial of service.The remedy is: upgrade to the patched 1.9.10 version.A workaround is to restrict the maximum number of queries on incoming TCP connections to a safe value, like 50, via the setMaxTCPQueriesPerConnection setting.We would like to thank Renaud Allard for bringing this issue to our attention.",
