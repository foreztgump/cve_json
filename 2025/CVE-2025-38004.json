    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:can: bcm: add locking for bcm_op runtime updatesThe CAN broadcast manager (CAN BCM) can send a sequence of CAN frames viahrtimer. The content and also the length of the sequence can be changedresp reduced at runtime where the 'currframe' counter is then set to zero.Although this appeared to be a safe operation the updates of 'currframe'can be triggered from user space and hrtimer context in bcm_can_tx().Anderson Nascimento created a proof of concept that triggered a KASANslab-out-of-bounds read access which can be prevented with a spin_lock_bh.At the rework of bcm_can_tx() the 'count' variable has been moved intothe protected section as this variable can be modified from both contextstoo.",
