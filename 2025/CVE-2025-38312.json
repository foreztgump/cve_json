    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:fbdev: core: fbcvt: avoid division by 0 in fb_cvt_hperiod()In fb_find_mode_cvt(), iff mode->refresh somehow happens to be 0x80000000,cvt.f_refresh will become 0 when multiplying it by 2 due to overflow. It'sthen passed to fb_cvt_hperiod(), where it's used as a divider -- divisionby 0 will result in kernel oops. Add a sanity check for cvt.f_refresh toavoid such overflow...Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with the Svace staticanalysis tool.",
