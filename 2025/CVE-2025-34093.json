        "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')"
    ],
    "description": "An authenticated command injection vulnerability exists in the Polycom HDX Series command shell interface accessible over Telnet. The lan traceroute command in the devcmds console accepts unsanitized input, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary system commands. By injecting shell metacharacters through the traceroute interface, an attacker can achieve remote code execution under the context of the root user. This flaw affects systems where Telnet access is enabled and either unauthenticated access is allowed or credentials are known.",
