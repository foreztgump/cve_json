    "description": "A vulnerability exists in Quick Heal Total Security 23.0.0 in the quarantine management component where insufficient validation of restore paths and improper permission handling allow a low-privileged local user to restore quarantined files into protected system directories. This behavior can be abused by a local attacker to place files in high-privilege locations, potentially leading to privilege escalation.",
