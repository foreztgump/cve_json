    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:pwm: mediatek: Prevent divide-by-zero in pwm_mediatek_config()With CONFIG_COMPILE_TEST && !CONFIG_HAVE_CLK, pwm_mediatek_config() has adivide-by-zero in the following line:\tdo_div(resolution, clk_get_rate(pc->clk_pwms[pwm->hwpwm]));due to the fact that the !CONFIG_HAVE_CLK version of clk_get_rate()returns zero.This is presumably just a theoretical problem: COMPILE_TEST overridesthe dependency on RALINK which would select COMMON_CLK.  Regardless it'sa good idea to check for the error explicitly to avoid divide-by-zero.Fixes the following warning:  drivers/pwm/pwm-mediatek.o: warning: objtool: .text: unexpected end of section[ukleinek: s/CONFIG_CLK/CONFIG_HAVE_CLK/]",
