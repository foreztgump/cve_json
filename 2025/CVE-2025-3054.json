    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type"
    ],
    "description": "The WP User Frontend Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the upload_files() function in all versions up to, and including, 4.1.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. Please note that this requires the 'Private Message' module to be enabled and the Business version of the PRO software to be in use.",
