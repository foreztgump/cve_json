    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:kasan: remove kasan_find_vm_area() to prevent possible deadlockfind_vm_area() couldn't be called in atomic_context.  If find_vm_area() iscalled to reports vm area information, kasan can trigger deadlock like:CPU0                                CPU1vmalloc(); alloc_vmap_area();  spin_lock(&vn->busy.lock)                                    spin_lock_bh(&some_lock);   <interrupt occurs>   <in softirq>   spin_lock(&some_lock);                                    <access invalid address>                                    kasan_report();                                     print_report();                                      print_address_description();                                       kasan_find_vm_area();                                        find_vm_area();                                         spin_lock(&vn->busy.lock) // deadlock!To prevent possible deadlock while kasan reports, remove kasan_find_vm_area().",
