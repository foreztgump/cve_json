    "description": "A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the built-in web interface of DiskBoss Enterprise versions 7.4.28, 7.5.12, and 8.2.14. The vulnerability arises from improper bounds checking on the path component of HTTP GET requests. By sending a specially crafted long URI, a remote unauthenticated attacker can trigger a buffer overflow, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM privileges on vulnerable Windows hosts.",
