    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:netfilter: ipset: fix region locking in hash typesRegion locking introduced in v5.6-rc4 contained three macros to handlethe region locks: ahash_bucket_start(), ahash_bucket_end() which gaveback the start and end hash bucket values belonging to a given regionlock and ahash_region() which should give back the region lock belongingto a given hash bucket. The latter was incorrect which can lead to arace condition between the garbage collector and adding new elementswhen a hash type of set is defined with timeouts.",
