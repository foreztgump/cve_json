        "CWE-1321 Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')"
    ],
    "description": "A prototype pollution vulnerability exists in @nyariv/sandboxjs versions <= 0.8.23, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary properties into Object.prototype via crafted JavaScript code. This can result in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition or, under certain conditions, escape the sandboxed environment intended to restrict code execution. The vulnerability stems from insufficient prototype access checks in the sandbox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s executor logic, particularly in the handling of JavaScript function objects returned.",
