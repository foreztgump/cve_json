    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:regulator: core: fix NULL dereference on unbind due to stale coupling dataFailing to reset coupling_desc.n_coupled after freeing coupled_rdevs canlead to NULL pointer dereference when regulators are accessed post-unbind.This can happen during runtime PM or other regulator operations that relyon coupling metadata.For example, on ridesx4, unbinding the 'reg-dummy' platform device triggersa panic in regulator_lock_recursive() due to stale coupling state.Ensure n_coupled is set to 0 to prevent access to invalid pointers.",
