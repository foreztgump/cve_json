    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:acpi: nfit: fix narrowing conversion in acpi_nfit_ctlSyzkaller has reported a warning in to_nfit_bus_uuid(): \"only secondarybus families can be translated\". This warning is emited if the argumentis equal to NVDIMM_BUS_FAMILY_NFIT == 0. Function acpi_nfit_ctl() firstverifies that a user-provided value call_pkg->nd_family of type u64 isnot equal to 0. Then the value is converted to int, and only after thatis compared to NVDIMM_BUS_FAMILY_MAX. This can lead to passing an invalidargument to acpi_nfit_ctl(), if call_pkg->nd_family is non-zero, whilethe lower 32 bits are zero.Furthermore, it is best to return EINVAL immediately upon seeing theinvalid user input.  The WARNING is insufficient to prevent furtherundefined behavior based on other invalid user input.All checks of the input value should be applied to the original variablecall_pkg->nd_family.[iweiny: update commit message]",
