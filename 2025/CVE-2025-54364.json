    ],
    "description": "Microsoft Knack 0.12.0 allows Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in the knack.introspection module. option_descriptions employs an inefficient regular expression pattern: \"\\s(:param)\\s+(.+?)\\s:(.*)\" that is susceptible to catastrophic backtracking when processing crafted docstrings containing a large volume of whitespace without a terminating colon. An attacker who can control or inject docstring content into affected applications can trigger excessive CPU consumption. This software is used by Azure CLI.",
