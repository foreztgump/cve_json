        "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
    ],
    "description": "The WP Travel Engine \u2013 Tour Booking Plugin \u2013 Tour Operator Software plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion (via renaming) due to insufficient file path validation in the set_user_profile_image function in all versions up to, and including, 6.6.7. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).",
