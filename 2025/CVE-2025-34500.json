    "product": "Deck Mate 2",
    "version": "0 ",
    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-321 Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key",
        "CWE-327 Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
        "CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature"
    ],
    "description": "Deck Mate 2's firmware update mechanism accepts packages without cryptographic signature verification, encrypts them with a single hard-coded AES key shared across devices, and uses a truncated HMAC for integrity validation. Attackers with access to the update interface - typically via the unit's USB update port - can craft or modify firmware packages to execute arbitrary code as root, allowing persistent compromise of the device's integrity and deck randomization process. Physical or on-premises access remains the most likely attack path, though network-exposed or telemetry-enabled deployments could theoretically allow remote exploitation if misconfigured. The vendor confirmed that firmware updates have been issued to correct these update-chain weaknesses and that USB update access has been disabled on affected units.",
