    "description": "A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in CodeIgniter4 v4.6.0 allows attackers to execute arbitrary web scripts or HTML via a crafted payload injected into the debugbar_time parameter. NOTE: this is disputed by the Supplier because attackers cannot influence the value of debugbar_time, and because debugbar-related data is automatically escaped by the CodeIgniter Parser class.",
