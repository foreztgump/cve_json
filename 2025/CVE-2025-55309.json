    ],
    "description": "An issue was discovered in Foxit PDF and Editor for Windows and macOS before 13.2 and 2025 before 2025.2. A crafted PDF can contain JavaScript that attaches an OnBlur action on a form field that destroys an annotation. During user right-click interaction, the program's internal focus change handling prematurely releases the annotation object, resulting in a use-after-free vulnerability that may cause memory corruption or application crashes.",
