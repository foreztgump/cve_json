Fix this by callingsynchronize_irq() to ensure that no interrupt is currently running whendisabling buffer mode.Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000000 when read[...]_find_first_bit_le from fxls8962af_fifo_flush+0x17c/0x290fxls8962af_fifo_flush from fxls8962af_interrupt+0x80/0x178fxls8962af_interrupt from irq_thread_fn+0x1c/0x7cirq_thread_fn from irq_thread+0x110/0x1f4irq_thread from kthread+0xe0/0xfckthread from ret_from_fork+0x14/0x2c",
