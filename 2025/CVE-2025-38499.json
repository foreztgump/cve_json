    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:clone_private_mnt(): make sure that caller has CAP_SYS_ADMIN in the right usernsWhat we want is to verify there is that clone won't expose somethinghidden by a mount we wouldn't be able to undo.  \"Wouldn't be able to undo\"may be a result of MNT_LOCKED on a child, but it may also come fromlacking admin rights in the userns of the namespace mount belongs to.clone_private_mnt() checks the former, but not the latter.There's a number of rather confusing CAP_SYS_ADMIN checks in varioususerns during the mount, especially with the new mount API; they servedifferent purposes and in case of clone_private_mnt() they usually,but not always end up covering the missing check mentioned above.",
