    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-346 Origin Validation Error"
    ],
    "description": "Langflow versions up to and including 1.6.9 contain a chained vulnerability that enables account takeover and remote code execution. An overly permissive CORS configuration (allow_origins='*' with allow_credentials=True) combined with a refresh token cookie configured as SameSite=None allows a malicious webpage to perform cross-origin requests that include credentials and successfully call the refresh endpoint. An attacker-controlled origin can therefore obtain fresh access_token / refresh_token pairs for a victim session. Obtained tokens permit access to authenticated endpoints \u2014 including built-in code-execution functionality \u2014 allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code and achieve full system compromise.",
