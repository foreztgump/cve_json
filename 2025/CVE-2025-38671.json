    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:i2c: qup: jump out of the loop in case of timeoutOriginal logic only sets the return value but doesn't jump out of theloop if the bus is kept active by a client. This is not expected. Amalicious or buggy i2c client can hang the kernel in this case andshould be avoided. This is observed during a long time test with aPCA953x GPIO extender.Fix it by changing the logic to not only sets the return value, but alsojumps out of the loop and return to the caller with -ETIMEDOUT.",
