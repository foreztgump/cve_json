    "description": "Three Bitnami Helm charts mount Kubernetes Secrets under a predictable path (/opt/bitnami/*/secrets) that is located within the web server document root.In affected versions, this can lead to unauthenticated access to sensitive credentials via HTTP/S. A remote attacker could retrieve these secrets by accessing specific URLs if the application is exposed externally. The issue affects deployments using the default value of usePasswordFiles=true, which mounts secrets as files into the container filesystem.",
