    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:netlabel: Fix NULL pointer exception caused by CALIPSO on IPv4 socketsWhen calling netlbl_conn_setattr(), addr->sa_family is usedto determine the function behavior. If sk is an IPv4 socket,but the connect function is called with an IPv6 address,the function calipso_sock_setattr() is triggered.Inside this function, the following code is executed:sk_fullsock(__sk) ? inet_sk(__sk)->pinet6 : NULL;Since sk is an IPv4 socket, pinet6 is NULL, leading to anull pointer dereference.This patch fixes the issue by checking if inet6_sk(sk)returns a NULL pointer before accessing pinet6.",
