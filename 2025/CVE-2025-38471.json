    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:tls: always refresh the queue when reading sockAfter recent changes in net-next TCP compacts skbs much moreaggressively. This unearthed a bug in TLS where we may tryto operate on an old skb when checking if all skbs in thequeue have matching decrypt state and geometry.
