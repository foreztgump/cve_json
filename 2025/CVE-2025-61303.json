    "description": "Hatching Triage Sandbox Windows 10 build 2004 (2025-08-14) and Windows 10 LTSC 2021(2025-08-14) contains a vulnerability in its Windows behavioral analysis engine that allows a submitted malware sample to evade detection and cause denial-of-analysis. The vulnerability is triggered when a sample recursively spawns a large number of child processes, generating high log volume and exhausting system resources. As a result, key malicious behavior, including PowerShell execution and reverse shell activity, may not be recorded or reported, misleading analysts and compromising the integrity and availability of sandboxed analysis results.",
