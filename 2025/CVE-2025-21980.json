    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:sched: address a potential NULL pointer dereference in the GRED scheduler.If kzalloc in gred_init returns a NULL pointer, the code follows theerror handling path, invoking gred_destroy. This, in turn, callsgred_offload, where memset could receive a NULL pointer as input,potentially leading to a kernel crash.When table->opt is NULL in gred_init(), gred_change_table_def()is not called yet, so it is not necessary to call ->ndo_setup_tc()in gred_offload().",
