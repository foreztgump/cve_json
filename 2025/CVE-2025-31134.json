        "CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data"
    ],
    "description": "FreshRSS is a self-hosted RSS feed aggregator. Prior to version 1.26.2, an attacker can gain additional information about the server by checking if certain directories exist. An attacker can, for example, check if older PHP versions are installed or if certain software is installed on the server and potentially use that information to further attack the server. Version 1.26.2 contains a patch for the issue.",
