    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: usb: asix_devices: add phy_mask for ax88772 mdio busWithout setting phy_mask for ax88772 mdio bus, current driver may createat most 32 mdio phy devices with phy address range from 0x00 ~ 0x1f.DLink DUB-E100 H/W Ver B1 is such a device. However, only one main phydevice will bind to net phy driver. This is creating issue during systemsuspend/resume since phy_polling_mode() in phy_state_machine() willdirectly deference member of phydev->drv for non-main phy devices. ThenNULL pointer dereference issue will occur. Due to only external phy orinternal phy is necessary, add phy_mask for ax88772 mdio bus to workarnoudthe issue.",
