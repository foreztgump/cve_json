    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
    ],
    "description": "The ZoloBlocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via multiple Gutenberg blocks in versions up to, and including, 2.3.10. This is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes within multiple block components including Google Maps markers, Lightbox captions, Image Gallery data attributes, Progress Pie prefix/suffix fields, and Text Path URL fields. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
