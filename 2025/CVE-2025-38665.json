    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:can: netlink: can_changelink(): fix NULL pointer deref of struct can_priv::do_set_modeAndrei Lalaev reported a NULL pointer deref when a CAN device isrestarted from Bus Off and the driver does not implement the structcan_priv::do_set_mode callback.There are 2 code path that call struct can_priv::do_set_mode:- directly by a manual restart from the user space, via  can_changelink()- delayed automatic restart after bus off (deactivated by default)To prevent the NULL pointer deference, refuse a manual restart orconfigure the automatic restart delay in can_changelink() and reportthe error via extack to user space.As an additional safety measure let can_restart() return an error ifcan_priv::do_set_mode is not set instead of dereferencing itunchecked.",
