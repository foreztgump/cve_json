    "description": "BigBlueButton is an open-source virtual classroom. A Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability in versions prior to 3.0.13 allows any authenticated user to freeze or crash the entire server by abusing the polling feature's `Choices` response type. By submitting a malicious payload with a massive array in the `answerIds` field, the attacker can cause the current meeting \u2014 and potentially all meetings on the server \u2014 to become unresponsive. Version 3.0.13 contains a patch. No known workarounds are available.",
