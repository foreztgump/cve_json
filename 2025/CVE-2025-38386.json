    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ACPICA: Refuse to evaluate a method if arguments are missingAs reported in [1], a platform firmware update that increased the numberof method parameters and forgot to update a least one of its callers,caused ACPICA to crash due to use-after-free.Since this a result of a clear AML issue that arguably cannot be fixedup by the interpreter (it cannot produce missing data out of thin air),address it by making ACPICA refuse to evaluate a method if the callerattempts to pass fewer arguments than expected to it.",
