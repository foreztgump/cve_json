    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:sunrpc: handle SVC_GARBAGE during svc auth processing as auth errortianshuo han reported a remotely-triggerable crash if the client sends akernel RPC server a specially crafted packet. If decoding the RPC replyfails in such a way that SVC_GARBAGE is returned without setting therq_accept_statp pointer, then that pointer can be dereferenced and avalue stored there.If it's the first time the thread has processed an RPC, then thatpointer will be set to NULL and the kernel will crash. In other cases,it could create a memory scribble.The server sunrpc code treats a SVC_GARBAGE return from svc_authenticateor pg_authenticate as if it should send a GARBAGE_ARGS reply. RFC 5531says that if authentication fails that the RPC should be rejectedinstead with a status of AUTH_ERR.Handle a SVC_GARBAGE return as an AUTH_ERROR, with a reason ofAUTH_BADCRED instead of returning GARBAGE_ARGS in that case. Thissidesteps the whole problem of touching the rpc_accept_statp pointer inthis situation and avoids the crash.",
