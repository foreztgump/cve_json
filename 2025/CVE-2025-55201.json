        "CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
    ],
    "description": "Copier library and CLI app for rendering project templates. Prior to 9.9.1, a safe template can currently read and write arbitrary files because Copier exposes a few pathlib.Path objects in the Jinja context which have unconstrained I/O methods. This effectively renders the security model w.r.t. filesystem access useless. This vulnerability is fixed in 9.9.1.",
