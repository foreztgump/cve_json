    "description": "The 'zipfile' module would not check the validity of the ZIP64 End ofCentral Directory (EOCD) Locator record offset value would not be used tolocate the ZIP64 EOCD record, instead the ZIP64 EOCD record would beassumed to be the previous record in the ZIP archive. This could be abusedto create ZIP archives that are handled differently by the 'zipfile' modulecompared to other ZIP implementations.Remediation maintains this behavior, but checks that the offset specifiedin the ZIP64 EOCD Locator record matches the expected value.",
