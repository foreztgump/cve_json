    ],
    "description": "Vasion Print (formerly PrinterLogic) Virtual Appliance Host and Application (VA and SaaS deployments) run many Docker containers on shared internal networks without firewalling or segmentation between instances. A compromise of any single container allows direct access to internal services (HTTP, Redis, MySQL, etc.) on the overlay network. From a compromised container, an attacker can reach and exploit other services, enabling lateral movement, data theft, and system-wide compromise.",
