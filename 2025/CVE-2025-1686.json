        "External Control of File Name or Path"
    ],
    "description": "All versions of the package io.pebbletemplates:pebble are vulnerable to External Control of File Name or Path via the include tag. A high privileged attacker can access sensitive local files by crafting malicious notification templates that leverage this tag to include files like /etc/passwd or /proc/1/environ.  Workaround This vulnerability can be mitigated by disabling the include macro in Pebble Templates: java\nnew PebbleEngine.Builder()\n            .registerExtensionCustomizer(new DisallowExtensionCustomizerBuilder()\n                    .disallowedTokenParserTags(List.of(\"include\"))\n                    .build())\n            .build();",
