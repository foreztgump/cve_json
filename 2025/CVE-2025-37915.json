    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net_sched: drr: Fix double list add in class with netem as child qdiscAs described in Gerrard's report [1], there are use cases where a netemchild qdisc will make the parent qdisc's enqueue callback reentrant.In the case of drr, there won't be a UAF, but the code will add the sameclassifier to the list twice, which will cause memory corruption.In addition to checking for qlen being zero, this patch checks whether theclass was already added to the active_list (cl_is_active) before addingto the list to cover for the reentrant case.[1] https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/CAHcdcOm+03OD2j6R0=YHKqmy=VgJ8xEOKuP6c7mSgnp-TEJJbw@mail.gmail.com/",
