    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/exynos: exynos7_drm_decon: add vblank check in IRQ handlingIf there's support for another console device (such as a TTY serial),the kernel occasionally panics during boot. The panic message and arelevant snippet of the call stack is as follows:  Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 000000000000000  Call trace:    drm_crtc_handle_vblank+0x10/0x30 (P)    decon_irq_handler+0x88/0xb4    [...]Otherwise, the panics don't happen. This indicates that it's some sortof race condition.Add a check to validate if the drm device can handle vblanks beforecalling drm_crtc_handle_vblank() to avoid this.",
