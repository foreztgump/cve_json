    "description": "vLLM is a high-throughput and memory-efficient inference and serving engine for LLMs. Versions starting from 0.8.0 and prior to 0.8.5 are affected by a critical performance vulnerability in the input preprocessing logic of the multimodal tokenizer. The code dynamically replaces placeholder tokens (e.g., <|audio_|>, <|image_|>) with repeated tokens based on precomputed lengths. Due to \u200b\u200binefficient list concatenation operations\u200b\u200b, the algorithm exhibits \u200b\u200bquadratic time complexity (O(n\u00b2))\u200b\u200b, allowing malicious actors to trigger resource exhaustion via specially crafted inputs. This issue has been patched in version 0.8.5.",
