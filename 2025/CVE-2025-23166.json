    "description": "The C++ method SignTraits::DeriveBits() may incorrectly call ThrowException() based on user-supplied inputs when executing in a background thread, crashing the Node.js process. Such cryptographic operations are commonly applied to untrusted inputs. Thus, this mechanism potentially allows an adversary to remotely crash a Node.js runtime.",
