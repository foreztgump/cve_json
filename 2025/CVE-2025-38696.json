    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:MIPS: Don't crash in stack_top() for tasks without ABI or vDSONot all tasks have an ABI associated or vDSO mapped,for example kthreads never do.If such a task ever ends up calling stack_top(), it will derefence theNULL ABI pointer and crash.This can for example happen when using kunit:    mips_stack_top+0x28/0xc0    arch_pick_mmap_layout+0x190/0x220    kunit_vm_mmap_init+0xf8/0x138    __kunit_add_resource+0x40/0xa8    kunit_vm_mmap+0x88/0xd8    usercopy_test_init+0xb8/0x240    kunit_try_run_case+0x5c/0x1a8    kunit_generic_run_threadfn_adapter+0x28/0x50    kthread+0x118/0x240    ret_from_kernel_thread+0x14/0x1cOnly dereference the ABI point if it is set.The GIC page is also included as it is specific to the vDSO.Also move the randomization adjustment into the same conditional.",
