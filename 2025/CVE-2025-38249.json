    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ALSA: usb-audio: Fix out-of-bounds read in snd_usb_get_audioformat_uac3()In snd_usb_get_audioformat_uac3(), the length value returned fromsnd_usb_ctl_msg() is used directly for memory allocation withoutvalidation. This length is controlled by the USB device.The allocated buffer is cast to a uac3_cluster_header_descriptorand its fields are accessed without verifying that the bufferis large enough. If the device returns a smaller than expectedlength, this leads to an out-of-bounds read.Add a length check to ensure the buffer is large enough foruac3_cluster_header_descriptor.",
