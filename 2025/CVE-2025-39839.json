    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:batman-adv: fix OOB read/write in network-coding decodebatadv_nc_skb_decode_packet() trusts coded_len and checks only againstskb->len. XOR starts at sizeof(struct batadv_unicast_packet), reducingpayload headroom, and the source skb length is not verified, allowing anout-of-bounds read and a small out-of-bounds write.Validate that coded_len fits within the payload area of both destinationand source sk_buffs before XORing.",
