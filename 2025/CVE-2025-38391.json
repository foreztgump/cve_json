    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:usb: typec: altmodes/displayport: do not index invalid pin_assignmentsA poorly implemented DisplayPort Alt Mode port partner can indicatethat its pin assignment capabilities are greater than the maximumvalue, DP_PIN_ASSIGN_F. In this case, calls to pin_assignment_showwill cause a BRK exception due to an out of bounds array access.Prevent for loop in pin_assignment_show from accessinginvalid values in pin_assignments by adding DP_PIN_ASSIGN_MAXvalue in typec_dp.h and using i < DP_PIN_ASSIGN_MAX as a loopcondition.",
