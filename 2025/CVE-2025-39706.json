    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/amdkfd: Destroy KFD debugfs after destroy KFD wqSince KFD proc content was moved to kernel debugfs, we can't destroy KFDdebugfs before kfd_process_destroy_wq. Move kfd_process_destroy_wq priorto kfd_debugfs_fini to fix a kernel NULL pointer problem. It happenswhen /sys/kernel/debug/kfd was already destroyed in kfd_debugfs_fini butkfd_process_destroy_wq calls kfd_debugfs_remove_process. This line    debugfs_remove_recursive(entry->proc_dentry);tries to remove /sys/kernel/debug/kfd/proc/<pid> while/sys/kernel/debug/kfd is already gone. It hangs the kernel by kernelNULL pointer.(cherry picked from commit 0333052d90683d88531558dcfdbf2525cc37c233)",
