    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:btrfs: fix iteration of extrefs during log replayAt __inode_add_ref() when processing extrefs, if we jump into the nextlabel we have an undefined value of victim_name.len, since we haven'tinitialized it before we did the goto. This results in an invalid memoryaccess in the next iteration of the loop since victim_name.len was notinitialized to the length of the name of the current extref.Fix this by initializing victim_name.len with the current extref's namelength.",
