    "description": "** DISPUTED ** A vulnerability has been found in HDF5 1.14.6 and classified as critical. This vulnerability affects the function H5T__bit_copy of the component Type Conversion Logic. The manipulation leads to heap-based buffer overflow. Local access is required to approach this attack. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The real existence of this vulnerability is still doubted at the moment. The vendor was contacted early about a batch of vulnerabilities. His response was \"reject\" without further explanation. We have not received an elaboration even after asking politely for further details. Currently we assume that the vendor wants to \"dispute\" the entries which is why they are flagged as such until further details become available.",
