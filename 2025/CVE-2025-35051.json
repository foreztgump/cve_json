    "description": "Newforma Project Center Server (NPCS) accepts serialized .NET data via the '/ProjectCenter.rem' endpoint on 9003/tcp, allowing a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code with 'NT AUTHORITY\\NetworkService' privileges. According to the recommended architecture, the vulnerable NPCS endpoint is only accessible on an internal network. To mitigate this vulnerability, restrict network access to NPCS.",
