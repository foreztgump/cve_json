        "Write-what-where Condition"
    ],
    "description": "A flaw was found in Libtiff. This vulnerability is a \"write-what-where\" condition, triggered when the library processes a specially crafted TIFF image file.By providing an abnormally large image height value in the file's metadata, an attacker can trick the library into writing attacker-controlled color data to an arbitrary memory location. This memory corruption can be exploited to cause a denial of service (application crash) or to achieve arbitrary code execution with the permissions of the user.",
