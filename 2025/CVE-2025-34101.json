    ],
    "description": "An unauthenticated command injection vulnerability exists in Serviio Media Server versions 1.4 through 1.8 on Windows, in the /rest/action API endpoint exposed by the console component (default port 23423). The checkStreamUrl method accepts a VIDEO parameter that is passed unsanitized to a call to cmd.exe, enabling arbitrary command execution under the privileges of the web server. No authentication is required to exploit this issue, as the REST API is exposed by default and lacks access controls.",
