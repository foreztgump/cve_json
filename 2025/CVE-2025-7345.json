    "version": "",
    "vulnerability": [
        "Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')"
    ],
    "description": "A flaw exists in gdk\u2011pixbuf within the gdk_pixbuf__jpeg_image_load_increment function (io-jpeg.c) and in glib\u2019s g_base64_encode_step (glib/gbase64.c). When processing maliciously crafted JPEG images, a heap buffer overflow can occur during Base64 encoding, allowing out-of-bounds reads from heap memory, potentially causing application crashes or arbitrary code execution.",
