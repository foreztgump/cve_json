    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:PCI: pnv_php: Fix surprise plug detection and recoveryThe existing PowerNV hotplug code did not handle surprise plug eventscorrectly, leading to a complete failure of the hotplug system after deviceremoval and a required reboot to detect new devices.This comes down to two issues: 1) When a device is surprise removed, often the bridge upstream    port will cause a PE freeze on the PHB.  If this freeze is not    cleared, the MSI interrupts from the bridge hotplug notification    logic will not be received by the kernel, stalling all plug events    on all slots associated with the PE. 2) When a device is removed from a slot, regardless of surprise or    programmatic removal, the associated PHB/PE ls left frozen.    If this freeze is not cleared via a fundamental reset, skiboot    is unable to clear the freeze and cannot retrain / rescan the    slot.  This also requires a reboot to clear the freeze and redetect    the device in the slot.Issue the appropriate unfreeze and rescan commands on hotplug events,and don't oops on hotplug if pci_bus_to_OF_node() returns NULL.[bhelgaas: tidy comments]",
