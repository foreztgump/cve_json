        "CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')"
    ],
    "description": "muffon is a cross-platform music streaming client for desktop. Versions prior to 2.3.0 have a one-click Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in. An attacker can exploit this issue by embedding a specially crafted `muffon://` link on any website they control. When a victim visits the site or clicks the link, the browser triggers Muffon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s custom URL handler, causing the application to launch and process the URL. This leads to RCE on the victim's machine without further interaction. Version 2.3.0 patches the issue.",
