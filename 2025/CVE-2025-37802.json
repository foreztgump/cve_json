    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ksmbd: fix WARNING \"do not call blocking ops when !TASK_RUNNING\"wait_event_timeout() will set the state of the currenttask to TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE, before doing the condition check. Thismeans that ksmbd_durable_scavenger_alive() will try to acquire the mutexwhile already in a sleeping state. The scheduler warns us by givingthe following warning:do not call blocking ops when !TASK_RUNNING; state=2 set at [<0000000061515a6f>] prepare_to_wait_event+0x9f/0x6c0WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 4147 at kernel/sched/core.c:10099 __might_sleep+0x12f/0x160mutex lock is not needed in ksmbd_durable_scavenger_alive().",
