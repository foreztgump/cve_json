    "description": "Saurus CMS Community Edition since commit d886e5b0 (2010-04-23) is vulnerable to a SQL Injection vulnerability in the `prepareSearchQuery()` method in `FulltextSearch.class.php`. The application directly concatenates user-supplied input (`$search_word`) into SQL queries without sanitization, allowing attackers to manipulate the SQL logic and potentially extract sensitive information or escalate their privileges.",
