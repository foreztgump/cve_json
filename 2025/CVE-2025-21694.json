    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:fs/proc: fix softlockup in __read_vmcore (part 2)Since commit 5cbcb62dddf5 (\"fs/proc: fix softlockup in __read_vmcore\") thenumber of softlockups in __read_vmcore at kdump time have gone down, butthey still happen sometimes.In a memory constrained environment like the kdump image, a softlockup isnot just a harmless message, but it can interfere with things like RCUfreeing memory, causing the crashdump to get stuck.The second loop in __read_vmcore has a lot more opportunities for naturalsleep points, like scheduling out while waiting for a data write tohappen, but apparently that is not always enough.Add a cond_resched() to the second loop in __read_vmcore to (hopefully)get rid of the softlockups.",
