    "description": "A vulnerability with a privilege management mechanism in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 app on Windows devices allows a locally authenticated non-administrative Windows user to escalate their privileges to NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM. However, execution requires that the local user can also successfully exploit a race condition, which makes this vulnerability difficult to exploit.",
