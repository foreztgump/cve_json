    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:scsi: lpfc: Use memcpy() for BIOS versionThe strlcat() with FORTIFY support is triggering a panic because itthinks the target buffer will overflow although the correct targetbuffer size is passed in.Anyway, instead of memset() with 0 followed by a strlcat(), just usememcpy() and ensure that the resulting buffer is NULL terminated.BIOSVersion is only used for the lpfc_printf_log() which expects aproperly terminated string.",
