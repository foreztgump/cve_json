    "description": "Astro is a web framework. In Astro versions 2.16.0 up to but excluding 5.15.5 which utilizeon-demand rendering, request headers `x-forwarded-proto` and `x-forwarded-port` are insecurely used, without sanitization, to build the URL. This has several consequences, the most important of which are: middleware-based protected route bypass (only via `x-forwarded-proto`), DoS via cache poisoning (if a CDN is present), SSRF (only via `x-forwarded-proto`), URL pollution (potential SXSS, if a CDN is present), and WAF bypass. Version 5.15.5 contains a patch.",
