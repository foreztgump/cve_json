    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:KVM: x86: Reset IRTE to host control if *new* route isn't postableRestore an IRTE back to host control (remapped or posted MSI mode) if the*new* GSI route prevents posting the IRQ directly to a vCPU, regardless ofthe GSI routing type.  Updating the IRTE if and only if the new GSI is anMSI results in KVM leaving an IRTE posting to a vCPU.The dangling IRTE can result in interrupts being incorrectly delivered tothe guest, and in the worst case scenario can result in use-after-free,e.g. if the VM is torn down, but the underlying host IRQ isn't freed.",
