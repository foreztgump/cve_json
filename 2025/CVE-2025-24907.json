        "CWE-35: Path Traversal: '.../...//'"
    ],
    "description": "Overview \u00a0The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize '.../...//' (doubled triple dot slash) sequences that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory. (CWE-35) \u00a0Description \u00a0Hitachi Vantara Pentaho Data Integration & Analytics versions before 10.2.0.2, including 9.3.x and 8.3.x, do not sanitize a user input used as a file path through the CGG Draw API. \u00a0Impact \u00a0This allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.",
