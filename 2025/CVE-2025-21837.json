    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:io_uring/uring_cmd: unconditionally copy SQEs at prep timeThis isn't generally necessary, but conditions have been observed whereSQE data is accessed from the original SQE after prep has been done andoutside of the initial issue. Opcode prep handlers must ensure that anySQE related data is stable beyond the prep phase, but uring_cmd is a bitspecial in how it handles the SQE which makes it susceptible to readingstale data. If the application has reused the SQE before the originalcompletes, then that can lead to data corruption.Down the line we can relax this again once uring_cmd has been sanitizeda bit, and avoid unnecessarily copying the SQE.",
