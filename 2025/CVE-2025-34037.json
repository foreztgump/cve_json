        "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation",
        "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')"
    ],
    "description": "An OS command injection vulnerability exists in various models of E-Series Linksys\u00c2\u00a0routers via the /tmUnblock.cgi and /hndUnblock.cgi endpoints over HTTP on port 8080. The CGI scripts improperly process user-supplied input passed to the ttcp_ip parameter without sanitization, allowing unauthenticated attackers to inject shell commands. This vulnerability is exploited in the wild by the \"TheMoon\" worm to deploy a MIPS ELF payload, enabling arbitrary code execution on the router. This vulnerability may affect other Linksys products to include, but not limited to, WAG/WAP/WES/WET/WRT-series router models and Wireless-N access points and routers.",
