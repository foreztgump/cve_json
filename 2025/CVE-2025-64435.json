        "CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions"
    ],
    "description": "KubeVirt is a virtual machine management add-on for Kubernetes. Prior to 1.7.0-beta.0, a logic flaw in the virt-controller allows an attacker to disrupt the control over a running VMI by creating a pod with the same labels as the legitimate virt-launcher pod associated with the VMI. This can mislead the virt-controller into associating the fake pod with the VMI, resulting in incorrect status updates and potentially causing a DoS (Denial-of-Service). This vulnerability is fixed in 1.7.0-beta.0.",
