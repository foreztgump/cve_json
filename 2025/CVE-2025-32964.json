        "CWE-285: Improper Authorization"
    ],
    "description": "ManageWiki is a MediaWiki extension allowing users to manage wikis. Prior to commit 00bebea, when enabling a conflicting extension, a restricted extension would be automatically disabled even if the user did not hold the ManageWiki-restricted right. This issue has been patched in commit 00bebea. A workaround involves ensuring that any extensions requiring specific permissions in `$wgManageWikiExtensions` also require the same permissions for managing any conflicting extensions.",
