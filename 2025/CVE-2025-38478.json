    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:comedi: Fix initialization of data for instructions that write to subdeviceSome Comedi subdevice instruction handlers are known to accessinstruction data elements beyond the first `insn->n` elements in somecases.  The `do_insn_ioctl()` and `do_insnlist_ioctl()` functionsallocate at least `MIN_SAMPLES` (16) data elements to deal with this,but they do not initialize all of that.  For Comedi instruction codesthat write to the subdevice, the first `insn->n` data elements arecopied from user-space, but the remaining elements are leftuninitialized.  That could be a problem if the subdevice instructionhandler reads the uninitialized data.  Ensure that the first`MIN_SAMPLES` elements are initialized before calling these instructionhandlers, filling the uncopied elements with 0.  For`do_insnlist_ioctl()`, the same data buffer elements are used forhandling a list of instructions, so ensure the first `MIN_SAMPLES`elements are initialized for each instruction that writes to thesubdevice.",
