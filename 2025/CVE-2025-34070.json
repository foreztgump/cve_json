        "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function"
    ],
    "description": "A missing authentication vulnerability in the GFIAgent component of GFI Kerio Control 9.4.5 allows unauthenticated remote attackers to perform privileged operations. The GFIAgent service, responsible for integration with GFI AppManager, exposes HTTP services on ports 7995 and 7996 without proper authentication. The /proxy handler on port 7996 allows arbitrary forwarding to administrative endpoints\u00c2\u00a0when provided with an Appliance UUID, which itself can be retrieved from port 7995. This results in a complete authentication bypass, permitting access to sensitive administrative APIs.",
