    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-88 Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')"
    ],
    "description": "Unity Runtime before 2025-10-02 on Android, Windows, macOS, and Linux allows argument injection that can result in loading of library code from an unintended location. If an application was built with a version of Unity Editor that had the vulnerable Unity Runtime code, then an adversary may be able to execute code on, and exfiltrate confidential information from, the machine on which that application is running. NOTE: product status is provided for Unity Editor because that is the information available from the Supplier. However, updating Unity Editor typically does not address the effects of the vulnerability; instead, it is necessary to rebuild and redeploy all affected applications.",
