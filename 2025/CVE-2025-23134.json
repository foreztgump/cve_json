    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ALSA: timer: Don't take register_mutex with copy_from/to_user()The infamous mmap_lock taken in copy_from/to_user() can be oftenproblematic when it's called inside another mutex, as they might leadto deadlocks.In the case of ALSA timer code, the bad pattern is withguard(mutex)(&register_mutex) that covers copy_from/to_user() -- whichwas mistakenly introduced at converting to guard(), and it had beencarefully worked around in the past.This patch fixes those pieces simply by moving copy_from/to_user() outof the register mutex lock again.",
