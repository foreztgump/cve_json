    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:LoongArch: Return NULL from huge_pte_offset() for invalid PMDLoongArch's huge_pte_offset() currently returns a pointer to a PMD sloteven if the underlying entry points to invalid_pte_table (indicating nomapping). Callers like smaps_hugetlb_range() fetch this invalid entryvalue (the address of invalid_pte_table) via this pointer.The generic is_swap_pte() check then incorrectly identifies this addressas a swap entry on LoongArch, because it satisfies the \"!pte_present()&& !pte_none()\" conditions. This misinterpretation, combined with acoincidental match by is_migration_entry() on the address bits, leads tokernel crashes in pfn_swap_entry_to_page().Fix this at the architecture level by modifying huge_pte_offset() tocheck the PMD entry's content using pmd_none() before returning. If theentry is invalid (i.e., it points to invalid_pte_table), return NULLinstead of the pointer to the slot.",
