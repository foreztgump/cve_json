    ],
    "description": "The DWT - Directory & Listing WordPress Theme is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 3.3.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on the 'sort_by' and 'token' parameters. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
