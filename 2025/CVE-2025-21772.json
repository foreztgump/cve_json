    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:partitions: mac: fix handling of bogus partition tableFix several issues in partition probing: - The bailout for a bad partoffset must use put_dev_sector(), since the   preceding read_part_sector() succeeded. - If the partition table claims a silly sector size like 0xfff bytes   (which results in partition table entries straddling sector boundaries),   bail out instead of accessing out-of-bounds memory. - We must not assume that the partition table contains proper NUL   termination - use strnlen() and strncmp() instead of strlen() and   strcmp().",
