    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ksmbd: Fix dangling pointer in krb_authenticatekrb_authenticate frees sess->user and does not set the pointerto NULL. It calls ksmbd_krb5_authenticate to reinitialisesess->user but that function may return without doing so. Ifthat happens then smb2_sess_setup, which calls krb_authenticate,will be accessing free'd memory when it later uses sess->user.",
