    "product": "DNSdist",
    "version": "1.9.0< 1.9.9 ",
    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-416 User After Free"
    ],
    "description": "When DNSdist is configured to provide DoH via the nghttp2 provider, an attacker can cause a denial of service by crafting a DoH exchange that triggers an illegal memory access (double-free) and crash of DNSdist, causing a denial of service.The remedy is: upgrade to the patched 1.9.9 version.A workaround is to temporarily switch to the h2o provider until DNSdist has been upgraded to a fixed version.We would like to thank Charles Howes for bringing this issue to our attention.",
