    "description": "The Ultimate Post Kit Addons for Elementor WordPress plugin before 4.0.16 exposes multiple AJAX \u201cload more\u201d endpoints such as upk_alex_grid_loadmore_posts without ensuring that posts to be displayed are published authentication. This allows an unauthenticated attacker to query arbitrary posts and retrieve rendered HTML content of private and unpublished ones.",
