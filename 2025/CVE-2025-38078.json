    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ALSA: pcm: Fix race of buffer access at PCM OSS layerThe PCM OSS layer tries to clear the buffer with the silence data atinitialization (or reconfiguration) of a stream with the explicit callof snd_pcm_format_set_silence() with runtime->dma_area.  But this maylead to a UAF because the accessed runtime->dma_area might be freedconcurrently, as it's performed outside the PCM ops.For avoiding it, move the code into the PCM core and perform it insidethe buffer access lock, so that it won't be changed during theoperation.",
