    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:md/raid1,raid10: don't ignore IO flagsIf blk-wbt is enabled by default, it's found that raid write performanceis quite bad because all IO are throttled by wbt of underlying disks,due to flag REQ_IDLE is ignored. And turns out this behaviour exist sinceblk-wbt is introduced.Other than REQ_IDLE, other flags should not be ignored as well, forexample REQ_META can be set for filesystems, clearing it can cause priorityreverse problems; And REQ_NOWAIT should not be cleared as well, becauseio will wait instead of failing directly in underlying disks.Fix those problems by keep IO flags from master bio.Fises: f51d46d0e7cb (\"md: add support for REQ_NOWAIT\")",
