    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ARM: rockchip: fix kernel hang during smp initializationIn order to bring up secondary CPUs main CPU write trampolinecode to SRAM. The trampoline code is written while secondaryCPUs are powered on (at least that true for RK3188 CPU).Sometimes that leads to kernel hang. Probably because secondaryCPU execute trampoline code while kernel doesn't expect.The patch moves SRAM initialization step to the point where allsecondary CPUs are powered down.That fixes rarely hangs on RK3188:[    0.091568] CPU0: thread -1, cpu 0, socket 0, mpidr 80000000[    0.091996] rockchip_smp_prepare_cpus: ncores 4",
