    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:x86/mm: Check return value from memblock_phys_alloc_range()At least with CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START=0x100000, if there is < 4 MiB ofcontiguous free memory available at this point, the kernel will crashand burn because memblock_phys_alloc_range() returns 0 on failure,which leads memblock_phys_free() to throw the first 4 MiB of physicalmemory to the wolves.At a minimum it should fail gracefully with a meaningful diagnostic,but in fact everything seems to work fine without the weird reserveallocation.",
