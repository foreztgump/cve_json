    "description": "A command injection vulnerability exists in the D-Link DIR-882 Router firmware DIR882A1_FW102B02 within the `prog.cgi` and `rc` binaries. The `sub_433188` function in `prog.cgi` stores user-supplied email configuration parameters (`EmailFrom`, `EmailTo`, `SMTPServerAddress`, `SMTPServerPort`, `AccountName`) in NVRAM via `nvram_safe_set`. These values are later retrieved in the `sub_448FDC` function of `rc` using `nvram_safe_get` and concatenated into shell commands executed via `twsystem()` without sanitization. An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary commands on the device through specially crafted HTTP requests to the router's web interface.",
