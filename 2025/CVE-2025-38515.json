    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/sched: Increment job count before swapping tail spsc queueA small race exists between spsc_queue_push and the run-job worker, inwhich spsc_queue_push may return not-first while the run-job worker hasalready idled due to the job count being zero. If this race occurs, jobscheduling stops, leading to hangs while waiting on the job\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DMAfences.Seal this race by incrementing the job count before appending to theSPSC queue.This race was observed on a drm-tip 6.16-rc1 build with the Xe driver inan SVM test case.",
