    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:page_pool: avoid infinite loop to schedule delayed workerWe noticed the kworker in page_pool_release_retry() was wakenup repeatedly and infinitely in production because of thebuggy driver causing the inflight less than 0 and warningus in page_pool_inflight()[1].Since the inflight value goes negative, it means we shouldnot expect the whole page_pool to get back to work normally.This patch mitigates the adverse effect by not reschedulingthe kworker when detecting the inflight negative inpage_pool_release_retry().[1][Mon Feb 10 20:36:11 2025] ------------[ cut here ]------------[Mon Feb 10 20:36:11 2025] Negative(-51446) inflight packet-pages...[Mon Feb 10 20:36:11 2025] Call Trace:[Mon Feb 10 20:36:11 2025]  page_pool_release_retry+0x23/0x70[Mon Feb 10 20:36:11 2025]  process_one_work+0x1b1/0x370[Mon Feb 10 20:36:11 2025]  worker_thread+0x37/0x3a0[Mon Feb 10 20:36:11 2025]  kthread+0x11a/0x140[Mon Feb 10 20:36:11 2025]  ? process_one_work+0x370/0x370[Mon Feb 10 20:36:11 2025]  ? __kthread_cancel_work+0x40/0x40[Mon Feb 10 20:36:11 2025]  ret_from_fork+0x35/0x40[Mon Feb 10 20:36:11 2025] ---[ end trace ebffe800f33e7e34 ]---Note: before this patch, the above calltrace would flood thedmesg due to repeated reschedule of release_dw kworker.",
