    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
    ],
    "description": "esm.sh is a nobuild content delivery network(CDN) for modern web development. Prior to version 136, the esm.sh CDN service is vulnerable to path traversal during NPM package tarball extraction. An attacker can craft a malicious NPM package containing specially crafted file paths (e.g., package/../../tmp/evil.js). When esm.sh downloads and extracts this package, files may be written to arbitrary locations on the server, escaping the intended extraction directory. This issue has been patched in version 136.",
