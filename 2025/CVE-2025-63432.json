The application fails to properly validate the TLS certificate from its update server. An attacker on the same network can exploit this vulnerability by performing a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack to intercept, decrypt, and modify traffic between the application and the update server. This serves as the basis for further attacks, including Remote Code Execution.",
