    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:NFC: nci: uart: Set tty->disc_data only in success pathSetting tty->disc_data before opening the NCI device means we need toclean it up on error paths.  This also opens some short window if devicestarts sending data, even before NCIUARTSETDRIVER IOCTL succeeded(broken hardware?).  Close the window by exposing tty->disc_data only onthe success path, when opening of the NCI device and try_module_get()succeeds.The code differs in error path in one aspect: tty->disc_data won't beever assigned thus NULL-ified.  This however should not be relevantdifference, because of \"tty->disc_data=NULL\" in nci_uart_tty_open().",
