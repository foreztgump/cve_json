    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:media: dvb-frontends: w7090p: fix null-ptr-deref in w7090p_tuner_write_serpar and w7090p_tuner_read_serparIn w7090p_tuner_write_serpar, msg is controlled by user. When msg[0].buf is null and msg[0].len is zero, former checks on msg[0].buf would be passed. If accessing msg[0].buf[2] without sanity check, null pointer deref would happen. We addcheck on msg[0].len to prevent crash.Similar commit: commit 0ed554fd769a (\"media: dvb-usb: az6027: fix null-ptr-deref in az6027_i2c_xfer()\")",
