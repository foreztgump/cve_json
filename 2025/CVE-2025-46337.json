        "CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')"
    ],
    "description": "ADOdb is a PHP database class library that provides abstractions for performing queries and managing databases. Prior to version 5.22.9, improper escaping of a query parameter may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL statements when the code using ADOdb connects to a PostgreSQL database and calls pg_insert_id() with user-supplied data. This issue has been patched in version 5.22.9.",
