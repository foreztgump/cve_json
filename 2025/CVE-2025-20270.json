    "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Evolved Programmable Network Manager (EPNM) and Cisco Prime Infrastructure could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to obtain sensitive information from an affected system. This vulnerability is due to improper validation of requests to API endpoints. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a valid request to a specific API endpoint within the affected system. A successful exploit could allow a low-privileged user to view sensitive configuration information on the affected system that should be restricted. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have access as a low-privileged user.&nbsp;&nbsp;",
