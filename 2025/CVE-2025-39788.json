    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:scsi: ufs: exynos: Fix programming of HCI_UTRL_NEXUS_TYPEOn Google gs101, the number of UTP transfer request slots (nutrs) is 32,and in this case the driver ends up programming the UTRL_NEXUS_TYPEincorrectly as 0.This is because the left hand side of the shift is 1, which is of typeint, i.e. 31 bits wide. Shifting by more than that width results inundefined behaviour.Fix this by switching to the BIT() macro, which applies correct typecasting as required. This ensures the correct value is written toUTRL_NEXUS_TYPE (0xffffffff on gs101), and it also fixes a UBSAN shiftwarning:    UBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in drivers/ufs/host/ufs-exynos.c:1113:21    shift exponent 32 is too large for 32-bit type 'int'For consistency, apply the same change to the nutmrs / UTMRL_NEXUS_TYPEwrite.",
