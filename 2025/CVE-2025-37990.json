The'state.state' and the 'state.bytes' are uninitialized if thefunction brcmf_usb_dl_cmd() fails. It is dangerous to useuninitialized variables in the conditions.Add error handling for brcmf_usb_dl_cmd() to jump to errorhandling path if the brcmf_usb_dl_cmd() fails and the'state.state' and the 'state.bytes' are uninitialized.Improve the error message to report more detailed errorinformation.",
