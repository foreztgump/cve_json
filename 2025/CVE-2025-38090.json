    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drivers/rapidio/rio_cm.c: prevent possible heap overwriteInriocm_cdev_ioctl(RIO_CM_CHAN_SEND)   -> cm_chan_msg_send()      -> riocm_ch_send()cm_chan_msg_send() checks that userspace didn't send too much data butriocm_ch_send() failed to check that userspace sent sufficient data.  Theresult is that riocm_ch_send() can write to fields in the rio_ch_chan_hdrwhich were outside the bounds of the space which cm_chan_msg_send()allocated.Address this by teaching riocm_ch_send() to check that the entirerio_ch_chan_hdr was copied in from userspace.",
