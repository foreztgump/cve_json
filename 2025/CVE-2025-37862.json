This happened both foroptional and required reports alike.The same logic was applied to pidff_find_special_field and althoughpidff_init_fields should return an error earlier if one of the requiredreports is missing, future modifications could change this logic andresurface this possible null pointer dereference again.LKML bug report:https://lore.kernel.org/all/CAL-gK7f5=R0nrrQdPtaZZr1fd-cdAMbDMuZ_NLA8vM0SX+nGSw@mail.gmail.com",
