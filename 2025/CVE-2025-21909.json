    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:wifi: nl80211: reject cooked mode if it is set along with other flagsIt is possible to set both MONITOR_FLAG_COOK_FRAMES and MONITOR_FLAG_ACTIVEflags simultaneously on the same monitor interface from the userspace. Thiscauses a sub-interface to be created with no IEEE80211_SDATA_IN_DRIVER bitset because the monitor interface is in the cooked state and it takesprecedence over all other states. When the interface is then being deletedthe kernel calls WARN_ONCE() from check_sdata_in_driver() because of missingthat bit.Fix this by rejecting MONITOR_FLAG_COOK_FRAMES if it is set along withother flags.Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with Syzkaller.",
