    "description": "A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the mtk_dut binary of Linksys E7350 routers (Firmware 1.1.00.032). The function sub_4045A8 reads up to 256 bytes from /sys/class/net/%s/address into a local buffer and then copies it into caller-provided buffer a1 using strcpy without boundary checks. Since a1 is often allocated with significantly smaller sizes (20-32 bytes), local attackers controlling the contents of /sys/class/net/%s/address can trigger buffer overflows, leading to memory corruption, denial of service, or potential arbitrary code execution.",
