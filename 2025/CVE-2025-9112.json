        "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type"
    ],
    "description": "The Doccure theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to incorrect file type validation in the 'doccure_temp_file_uploader' function in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.8. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level and above permissions, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.",
