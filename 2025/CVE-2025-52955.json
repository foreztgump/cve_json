    ],
    "description": "An Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size vulnerability in the routing protocol daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an adjacent unauthenticated attacker to cause a memory corruption that leads\u00a0to a rpd crash.\u00a0Whenthe logical interface using a routing instance flaps continuously, specific updates are sent to the jflow/sflow modules. This results in memory corruption, leading to an rpd crash and restart.\u00a0Continued receipt of these specific updates will cause a sustained Denial of Service condition.This issue affects Junos OS:  *  All versions before 21.2R3-S9,   *  All versions of 21.4,   *  All versions of 22.2,   *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S7,   *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S3,   *  from 23.4 before 23.4R2-S4,   *  from 24.2 before 24.2R2.Junos OS Evolved:\u00a0  *  All versions of 21.2-EVO,\u00a0  *  All versions of 21.4-EVO,\u00a0  *  All versions of 22.2-EVO,\u00a0  *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S7-EVO,\u00a0  *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S3-EVO,\u00a0  *  from 23.4 before 23.4R2-S4-EVO,\u00a0  *  from 24.2 before 24.2R2-EVO.",
