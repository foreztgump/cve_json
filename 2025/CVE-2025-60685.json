    "description": "A stack buffer overflow exists in the ToToLink A720R Router firmware V4.1.5cu.614_B20230630 within the sysconf binary (sub_401EE0 function). The binary reads the /proc/stat file using fgets() into a local buffer and subsequently parses the line using sscanf() into a single-byte variable with the %s format specifier. Maliciously crafted /proc/stat content can overwrite adjacent stack memory, potentially allowing an attacker with filesystem write privileges to execute arbitrary code on the device.",
