        "CWE-330 Use of Insufficiently Random Values"
    ],
    "description": "The MCP SSE endpoint in oatpp-mcp returns an instance pointer as the session ID, which is not unique nor cryptographically secure. This allows network attackers with access to the oatpp-mcp server to guess future session IDs and hijack legitimate client MCP sessions, returning malicious responses from the oatpp-mcp server.",
