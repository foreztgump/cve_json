    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-24 Path Traversal: '../filedir'"
    ],
    "description": "A path traversal (directory traversal) vulnerability in D-Link DSR series routers allows unauthenticated remote attackers to manipulate input parameters used for file or directory path resolution (e.g., via sequences such as \u201c../\u201d). Successful exploitation may allow access to files outside of the intended directory, potentially exposing sensitive system or configuration files. The issue results from insufficient validation or sanitization of user-supplied input. Affected Products include: DSR-150, DSR-150N, and DSR-250N v1.09B32_WW.",
