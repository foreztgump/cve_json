        "CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data"
    ],
    "description": "Deno is a JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly runtime. Prior to versions 2.1.13 and 2.2.13, the `Deno.env.toObject` method ignores any variables listed in the `--deny-env` option of the `deno run` command. When looking at the documentation of the `--deny-env` option this might lead to a false impression that variables listed in the option are impossible to read. Software relying on the combination of both flags to allow access to most environment variables except a few sensitive ones will be vulnerable to malicious code trying to steal secrets using the `Deno.env.toObject()` method. Versions 2.1.13 and 2.2.13 contains a patch.",
