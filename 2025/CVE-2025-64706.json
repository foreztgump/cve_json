In version 3.9.0 up to but excluding version 3.13.0, an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the API token management endpoint. An authenticated attacker can delete any user's API token and retrieve its value by simply knowing the target user's ID and token ID, without requiring authorization checks. Version 3.13.0 fixes the issue.",
