    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:comedi: Fail COMEDI_INSNLIST ioctl if n_insns is too largeThe handling of the `COMEDI_INSNLIST` ioctl allocates a kernel buffer tohold the array of `struct comedi_insn`, getting the length from the`n_insns` member of the `struct comedi_insnlist` supplied by the user.The allocation will fail with a WARNING and a stack dump if it is toolarge.Avoid that by failing with an `-EINVAL` error if the supplied `n_insns`value is unreasonable.Define the limit on the `n_insns` value in the `MAX_INSNS` macro.  Setthis to the same value as `MAX_SAMPLES` (65536), which is the maximumallowed sum of the values of the member `n` in the array of `structcomedi_insn`, and sensible comedi instructions will have an `n` of atleast 1.",
