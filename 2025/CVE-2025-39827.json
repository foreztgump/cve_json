    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: rose: include node references in rose_neigh refcountCurrent implementation maintains two separate reference countingmechanisms: the 'count' field in struct rose_neigh tracks references fromrose_node structures, while the 'use' field (now refcount_t) tracksreferences from rose_sock.This patch merges these two reference counting systems using 'use' fieldfor proper reference management. Specifically, this patch adds incrementingand decrementing of rose_neigh->use when rose_neigh->count is incrementedor decremented.This patch also modifies rose_rt_free(), rose_rt_device_down() androse_clear_route() to properly release references to rose_neigh objectsbefore freeing a rose_node through rose_remove_node().These changes ensure rose_neigh structures are properly freed only whenall references, including those from rose_node structures, are released.As a result, this resolves a slab-use-after-free issue reported by Syzbot.",
