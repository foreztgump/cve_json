        "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation"
    ],
    "description": "The backup restore function does not properly validate unexpected or unrecognized tags within the backup file. When such a crafted file is restored, the injected tag is interpreted by a shell, allowing execution of arbitrary commands with root privileges. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to gain root-level command execution, compromising confidentiality, integrity and availability.",
