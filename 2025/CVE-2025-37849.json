    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:KVM: arm64: Tear down vGIC on failed vCPU creationIf kvm_arch_vcpu_create() fails to share the vCPU page with thehypervisor, we propagate the error back to the ioctl but leave thevGIC vCPU data initialised. Note only does this leak the correspondingmemory when the vCPU is destroyed but it can also lead to use-after-freeif the redistributor device handling tries to walk into the vCPU.Add the missing cleanup to kvm_arch_vcpu_create(), ensuring that thevGIC vCPU structures are destroyed on error.",
