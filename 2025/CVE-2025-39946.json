    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:tls: make sure to abort the stream if headers are bogusNormally we wait for the socket to buffer up the whole recordbefore we service it. If the socket has a tiny buffer, however,we read out the data sooner, to prevent connection stalls.Make sure that we abort the connection when we find out latethat the record is actually invalid. Retrying the parsing isfine in itself but since we copy some more data each timebefore we parse we can overflow the allocated skb space.Constructing a scenario in which we're under pressure withoutenough data in the socket to parse the length upfront is quitehard. syzbot figured out a way to do this by serving us the headerin small OOB sends, and then filling in the recvbuf with a largenormal send.Make sure that tls_rx_msg_size() aborts strp, if we reachan invalid record there's really no way to recover.",
