    "description": "A Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in the routing protocol daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows a local, low privileged user to cause an impact to the availability of the device.When RIB sharding is enabled and a user executes one of several routing related 'show' commands, a certain amount of memory is leaked. When all available memory has been consumed rpd will crash and restart.The leak can be monitored with the CLI command:show task memory detail | match task_shard_mgmt_cookiewhere the allocated memory in bytes can be seen to continuously increase with each exploitation.This issue affects:Junos OS:  *  all versions before 21.2R3-S9,  *  21.4 versions before 21.4R3-S11,  *  22.2 versions before 22.2R3-S7,  *  22.4 versions before 22.4R3-S7,  *  23.2 versions before 23.2R2-S4,\u00a0  *  23.4 versions before 23.4R2-S4,  *  24.2 versions before 24.2R2,  *  24.4 versions before 24.4R1-S2, 24.4R2;Junos OS Evolved:  *  all versions before 22.2R3-S7-EVO  *  22.4-EVO versions before 22.4R3-S7-EVO,  *  23.2-EVO versions before 23.2R2-S4-EVO,  *  23.4-EVO versions before 23.4R2-S4-EVO,  *  24.2-EVO versions before 24.2R2-EVO,\u00a0  *  24.4-EVO versions before 24.4R2-EVO.",
