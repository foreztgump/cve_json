        "CWE-416: Use After Free"
    ],
    "description": "Poppler is a PDF rendering library. Versions prior to 25.06.0 use `std::atomic_int` for reference counting. Because `std::atomic_int` is only 32 bits, it is possible to overflow the reference count and trigger a use-after-free. Version 25.06.0 patches the issue.",
