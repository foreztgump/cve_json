    "description": "Vasion Print (formerly PrinterLogic) Virtual Appliance Host prior to version 22.0.1026\u00a0and Application prior to version 20.0.2702\u00a0(VA deployments only)\u00a0expose a set of unauthenticated REST API endpoints that return configuration files and clear\u2011text passwords. The same endpoints also disclose the Laravel APP_KEY used for cryptographic signing. Because the APP_KEY is required to generate valid signed requests, an attacker who obtains it can craft malicious payloads that are accepted by the application and achieve remote code execution on the appliance.\u00a0This vulnerability has been identified by the vendor as: V-2024-018 \u2014 RCE & Leaks via API.",
