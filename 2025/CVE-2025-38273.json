    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: tipc: fix refcount warning in tipc_aead_encryptsyzbot reported a refcount warning [1] caused by calling get_net() ona network namespace that is being destroyed (refcount=0). This happenswhen a TIPC discovery timer fires during network namespace cleanup.The recently added get_net() call in commit e279024617134 (\"net/tipc:fix slab-use-after-free Read in tipc_aead_encrypt_done\") attempts tohold a reference to the network namespace. However, if the namespaceis already being destroyed, its refcount might be zero, leading to theuse-after-free warning.Replace get_net() with maybe_get_net(), which safely checks if therefcount is non-zero before incrementing it. If the namespace is beingdestroyed, return -ENODEV early, after releasing the bearer reference.[1]: https://lore.kernel.org/all/68342b55.a70a0220.253bc2.0091.GAE@google.com/T/#m12019cf9ae77e1954f666914640efa36d52704a2",
