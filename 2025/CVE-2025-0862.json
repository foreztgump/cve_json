        "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
    ],
    "description": "The SuperSaaS \u2013 online appointment scheduling plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the \u2018after\u2019 parameter in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.12 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This is limited to Chromium-based browsers (e.g. Chrome, Edge, Brave).",
