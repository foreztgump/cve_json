    "product": "Access Manager 92xx-k5",
    "version": "92xx-K5: <XAMB 04.06.212 ",
    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-291: Reliance on IP Address for Authentication"
    ],
    "description": "Instead of typical session tokens or cookies, it is verified on a per-request basis if the originating IP address has once successfully logged in. As soon as an authentication request from a certain source IP is successful, the IP address is handled as authenticated. No other session information is stored. Therefore, it is possible to spoof the IP address of a logged-in user to gain access to the Access Manager web interface.",
