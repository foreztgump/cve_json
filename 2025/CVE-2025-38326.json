This queue was added aspart of the conversion to blk_mq. However, the queue was not cleaned outwhen an aoe device is downed which caused blk_mq_freeze_queue() to sleepindefinitely waiting for those requests to complete, causing a hang. Thisfix cleans out the queue before calling blk_mq_freeze_queue().",
