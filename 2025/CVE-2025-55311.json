    ],
    "description": "An issue was discovered in Foxit PDF and Editor for Windows and macOS before 13.2 and 2025 before 2025.2. A crafted PDF can use JavaScript to alter annotation content and subsequently clear the file's modification status via JavaScript interfaces. This circumvents digital signature verification by hiding document modifications, allowing an attacker to mislead users about the document's integrity and compromise the trustworthiness of signed PDFs.",
