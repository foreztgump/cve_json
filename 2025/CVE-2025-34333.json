    "description": "AudioCodes Fax Server and Auto-Attendant IVR appliances versions up to and including 2.6.23\u00c2\u00a0configure the web document root at C:\\\\F2MAdmin\\\\F2E with overly permissive file system permissions. Authenticated local users have modify rights on this directory, while the associated web server process runs as NT AUTHORITY\\\\SYSTEM. As a result, any local user can create or alter server-side scripts within the webroot and then trigger them via HTTP requests, causing arbitrary code to execute with SYSTEM privileges.",
