    "description": "AudioCodes Fax Server and Auto-Attendant IVR appliances versions up to and including 2.6.23\u00c2\u00a0expose an authenticated command injection vulnerability in the license activation workflow handled by AudioCodes_files/ActivateLicense.php. When a license file is uploaded, the application derives a new filename by combining a generated base name with the attacker-controlled extension portion of the original upload name, then constructs a command line for fax_server_lic_cmdline.exe that includes this path. The extension value is incorporated into the command string without input validation, escaping, or proper argument quotation before being passed to exec(). An authenticated user with access to the license upload interface can supply a specially crafted filename whose extension injects additional shell metacharacters, causing arbitrary commands to be executed as NT AUTHORITY\\\\SYSTEM.",
