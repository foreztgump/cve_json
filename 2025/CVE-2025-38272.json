    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: dsa: b53: do not enable EEE on bcm63xxBCM63xx internal switches do not support EEE, but provide multiple RGMIIports where external PHYs may be connected. If one of these PHYs are EEEcapable, we may try to enable EEE for the MACs, which then hangs thesystem on access of the (non-existent) EEE registers.Fix this by checking if the switch actually supports EEE beforeattempting to configure it.",
