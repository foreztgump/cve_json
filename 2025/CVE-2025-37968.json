    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:iio: light: opt3001: fix deadlock due to concurrent flag accessThe threaded IRQ function in this driver is reading the flag twice: once tolock a mutex and once to unlock it. Even though the code setting the flagis designed to prevent it, there are subtle cases where the flag could betrue at the mutex_lock stage and false at the mutex_unlock stage. Thisresults in the mutex not being unlocked, resulting in a deadlock.Fix it by making the opt3001_irq() code generally more robust, reading theflag into a variable and using the variable value at both stages.",
