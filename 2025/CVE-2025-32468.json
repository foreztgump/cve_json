    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-680: Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "description": "A memory corruption vulnerability exists in the BMPv3 Image Decoding functionality of the SAIL Image Decoding Library v0.9.8. When loading a specially crafted .bmp file, an integer overflow can be made to occur when calculating the stride for decoding. Afterwards, this will cause a heap-based buffer to overflow when decoding the image which can lead to remote code execution. An attacker will need to convince the library to read a file to trigger this vulnerability.",
