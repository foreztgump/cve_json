    "description": "git-commiters is a Node.js function module providing committers stats for their git repository. Prior to version 0.1.2, there is a command injection vulnerability in git-commiters. This vulnerability manifests with the library's primary exported API: gitCommiters(options, callback) which allows specifying options such as cwd for current working directory and revisionRange as a revision pointer, such as HEAD. However, the library does not sanitize for user input or practice secure process execution API to separate commands from their arguments and as such, uncontrolled user input is concatenated into command execution. This issue has been patched in version 0.1.2.",
