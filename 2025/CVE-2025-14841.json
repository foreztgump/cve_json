The impacted element is the function DcmQueryRetrieveIndexDatabaseHandle::startFindRequest/DcmQueryRetrieveIndexDatabaseHandle::startMoveRequest in the library dcmqrdb/libsrc/dcmqrdbi.cc of the component dcmqrscp. This manipulation causes null pointer dereference. The attack requires local access. Upgrading to version 3.7.0 is sufficient to resolve this issue.
