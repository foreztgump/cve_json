        "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')"
    ],
    "description": "An authenticated remote code execution vulnerability exists in Pandora FMS version 7.0NG and earlier. The net_tools.php functionality allows authenticated users to execute arbitrary OS commands via the select_ips parameter when performing network tools operations, such as pinging. This occurs because user input is not properly sanitized before being passed to system commands, enabling command injection.",
