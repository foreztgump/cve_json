    "description": "The Microsoft vulnerable driver block list is implemented as Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) policy. Entries that specify only the to-be-signed (TBS) part of the code signer certificate are properly blocked, but entries that specify the signing certificate's TBS hash along with a 'FileAttribRef' qualifier (such as file name or version) may not be blocked, whether hypervisor-protected code integrity (HVCI) is enabled or not. NOTE: The vendor disputes this CVE ID assignment and states that the driver blocklist is intended for use with HVCI.",
