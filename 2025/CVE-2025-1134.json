    "description": "A vulnerability exists in ChurchCRM\u00a05.13.0 and prior that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries by exploiting a boolean-based and time-based blind SQL Injection\u00a0vulnerability in the DonatedItemEditor\u00a0functionality. The CurrentFundraiser\u00a0parameter is directly concatenated into an SQL query without sufficient sanitization, allowing an attacker to manipulate database queries and execute arbitrary commands, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. Please note that this vulnerability requires Administrator privileges.",
