    "description": "Traccar is an open source GPS tracking system. Default installs of Traccar on Windows between versions 6.1-  6.8.1 and non default installs between versions 5.8 - 6.0 are vulnerable to unauthenticated local file inclusion attacks which can lead to leakage of passwords or any file on the file system including the Traccar configuration file. Versions 5.8 - 6.0 are only vulnerable if <entry key='web.override'>./override</entry> is set in the configuration file. Versions 6.1 - 6.8.1 are vulnerable by default as the web override is enabled by default. The vulnerable code is removed in version 6.9.0.",
