    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: tls: explicitly disallow disconnectsyzbot discovered that it can disconnect a TLS socket and thenrun into all sort of unexpected corner cases. I have a vaguerecollection of Eric pointing this out to us a long time ago.Supporting disconnect is really hard, for one thing if offloadis enabled we'd need to wait for all packets to be _acked_.Disconnect is not commonly used, disallow it.The immediate problem syzbot run into is the warning in the strp,but that's just the easiest bug to trigger:  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 5834 at net/tls/tls_strp.c:486 tls_strp_msg_load+0x72e/0xa80 net/tls/tls_strp.c:486  RIP: 0010:tls_strp_msg_load+0x72e/0xa80 net/tls/tls_strp.c:486  Call Trace:   <TASK>   tls_rx_rec_wait+0x280/0xa60 net/tls/tls_sw.c:1363   tls_sw_recvmsg+0x85c/0x1c30 net/tls/tls_sw.c:2043   inet6_recvmsg+0x2c9/0x730 net/ipv6/af_inet6.c:678   sock_recvmsg_nosec net/socket.c:1023 [inline]   sock_recvmsg+0x109/0x280 net/socket.c:1045   __sys_recvfrom+0x202/0x380 net/socket.c:2237",
