    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net_sched: qfq: Fix double list add in class with netem as child qdiscAs described in Gerrard's report [1], there are use cases where a netemchild qdisc will make the parent qdisc's enqueue callback reentrant.In the case of qfq, there won't be a UAF, but the code will add the sameclassifier to the list twice, which will cause memory corruption.This patch checks whether the class was already added to the agg->activelist (cl_is_active) before doing the addition to cater for the reentrantcase.[1] https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/CAHcdcOm+03OD2j6R0=YHKqmy=VgJ8xEOKuP6c7mSgnp-TEJJbw@mail.gmail.com/",
