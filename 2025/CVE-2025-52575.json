        "CWE-90: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an LDAP Query ('LDAP Injection')"
    ],
    "description": "EspoCRM is an Open Source CRM (Customer Relationship Management) software. EspoCRM versions 9.1.6 and earlier are vulnerable to blind LDAP Injection when LDAP authentication is enabled. A remote, unauthenticated attacker can manipulate LDAP queries by injecting crafted input containing wildcard characters (e.g., *). This may allow the attacker to bypass authentication controls, enumerate valid usernames, or retrieve sensitive directory information depending on the LDAP server configuration. This was fixed in version 9.1.7.",
