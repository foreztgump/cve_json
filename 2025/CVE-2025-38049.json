    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:x86/resctrl: Fix allocation of cleanest CLOSID on platforms with no monitorsCommit  6eac36bb9eb0 (\"x86/resctrl: Allocate the cleanest CLOSID by searching closid_num_dirty_rmid\")added logic that causes resctrl to search for the CLOSID with the fewest dirtycache lines when creating a new control group, if requested by the arch code.This depends on the values read from the llc_occupancy counters. The logic isapplicable to architectures where the CLOSID effectively forms part of themonitoring identifier and so do not allow complete freedom to choose an unusedmonitoring identifier for a given CLOSID.This support missed that some platforms may not have these counters.  Thiscauses a NULL pointer dereference when creating a new control group as thearray was not allocated by dom_data_init().As this feature isn't necessary on platforms that don't have cache occupancymonitors, add this to the check that occurs when a new control group isallocated.",
