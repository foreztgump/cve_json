    "description": "It was discovered that dpkg-deb does not properly sanitize directory permissions when extracting a control member into a temporary directory, which isdocumented as being a safe operation even on untrusted data. This may result in leaving temporary files behind on cleanup. Given automated and repeated execution of dpkg-deb commands onadversarial .deb packages or with well compressible files, placedinside a directory with permissions not allowing removal by a non-rootuser, this can end up in a DoS scenario due to causing disk quotaexhaustion or disk full conditions.",
