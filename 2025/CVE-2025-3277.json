    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-122 Heap-based Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "description": "An integer overflow can be triggered in SQLite\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s `concat_ws()` function. The resulting, truncated integer is then used to allocate a buffer. When SQLite then writes the resulting string to the buffer, it uses the original, untruncated size and thus a wild Heap Buffer overflow of size ~4GB can be triggered. This can result in arbitrary code execution.",
