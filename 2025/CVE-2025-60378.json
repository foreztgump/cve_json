    "description": "Stored HTML injection in RISE Ultimate Project Manager & CRM allows authenticated users to inject arbitrary HTML into invoices and messages. Injected content renders in emails, PDFs, and messaging/chat modules sent to clients or team members, enabling phishing, credential theft, and business email compromise.
