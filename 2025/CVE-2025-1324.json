    ],
    "description": "The WP-Recall \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Registration, Profile, Commerce & More plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'public-form' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 16.26.10 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
