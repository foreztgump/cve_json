    "description": "A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in the ResetPasswordRequest operation of Zimbra Collaboration (ZCS) when the zimbraFeatureResetPasswordStatus attribute is enabled. An attacker can exploit this by tricking an authenticated user into visiting a malicious webpage that silently sends a crafted SOAP request to reset the user's password. The vulnerability stems from a lack of CSRF token validation on the endpoint, allowing password resets without the user's consent.",
