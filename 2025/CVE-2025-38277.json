    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mtd: nand: ecc-mxic: Fix use of uninitialized variable retIf ctx->steps is zero, the loop processing ECC steps is skipped,and the variable ret remains uninitialized. It is later checkedand returned, which leads to undefined behavior and may causeunpredictable results in user space or kernel crashes.This scenario can be triggered in edge cases such as misconfiguredgeometry, ECC engine misuse, or if ctx->steps is not validatedafter initialization.Initialize ret to zero before the loop to ensure correct and safebehavior regardless of the ctx->steps value.Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.",
