    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:s390/ism: add release function for struct deviceAccording to device_release() in /drivers/base/core.c,a device without a release function is a broken deviceand must be fixed.The current code directly frees the device after calling device_add()without waiting for other kernel parts to release their references.Thus, a reference could still be held to a struct device,e.g., by sysfs, leading to potential use-after-freeissues if a proper release function is not set.",
