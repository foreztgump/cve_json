    "description": "A path Traversal vulnerability found in FileCodeBox v2.2 and earlier allows arbitrary file writes when application is configured to use local filesystem storage. SystemFileStorage.save_file method in core/storage.py uses filenames from user input without validation to construct save_path and save files. This allows remote attackers to perform arbitrary file writes outside the intended directory by sending crafted POST requests with malicious traversal sequences to /share/file/ upload endpoint, which does not require any authorization.",
