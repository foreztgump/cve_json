    "version": "< 4.10.2 ",
    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-124: Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow')"
    ],
    "description": "Wazuh is a free and open source platform used for threat prevention, detection, and response. A heap-based out-of-bounds WRITE occurs in decode_win_permissions, resulting in writing a NULL byte 2 bytes before the start of the buffer allocated to decoded_it. A compromised agent can potentially leverage this issue to perform remote code execution, by sending a specially crafted message to the wazuh manager. An attacker who is able to craft and send an agent message to the wazuh manager can leverage this issue to potentially achieve remote code execution on the wazuh manager (the exploitability of this vulnerability depends on the specifics of the respective heap allocator). This vulnerability is fixed in 4.10.2.",
