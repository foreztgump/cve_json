    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:vsock/virtio: Validate length in packet header before skb_put()When receiving a vsock packet in the guest, only the virtqueue buffersize is validated prior to virtio_vsock_skb_rx_put(). Unfortunately,virtio_vsock_skb_rx_put() uses the length from the packet header as thelength argument to skb_put(), potentially resulting in SKB overflow ifthe host has gone wonky.Validate the length as advertised by the packet header before callingvirtio_vsock_skb_rx_put().",
