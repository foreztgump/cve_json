    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:perf/core: Exit early on perf_mmap() failWhen perf_mmap() fails to allocate a buffer, it still invokes theevent_mapped() callback of the related event. On X86 this might increasethe perf_rdpmc_allowed reference counter. But nothing undoes this asperf_mmap_close() is never called in this case, which causes anotherreference count leak.Return early on failure to prevent that.",
