        "CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "description": "A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the MFER parsing functionality of The Biosig Project libbiosig 3.9.0 and Master Branch (35a819fa). A specially crafted MFER file can lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.This vulnerability manifests on line 9141 of biosig.c on the current master branch (35a819fa), when the Tag is 67:                 else if (tag==67)     //0x43: Sample skew\n                {\n                    int skew=0;     // [1]\n                    curPos += ifread(&skew, 1, len,hdr); In this case, the address of the newly-defined integer `skew` \\[1\\] is overflowed instead of `buf`. This means a stack overflow can occur using much smaller values of `len` in this code path.",
