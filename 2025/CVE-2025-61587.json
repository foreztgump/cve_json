        "CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')"
    ],
    "description": "Weblate is a web based localization tool. An open redirect exists in versions 5.13.2 and below via the redir parameter on .within.website when Weblate is configured with Anubis and REDIRECT_DOMAINS is not set. An attacker can craft a URL on the legitimate domain that redirects a victim to an attacker-controlled site. The redirect can also be used to initiate drive-by downloads (redirecting to a URL that serves a malicious file), increasing the risk to end users. This issue is fixed in version 5.13.3.",
