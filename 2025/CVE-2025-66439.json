    "description": "An issue was discovered in Frappe ERPNext through 15.89.0. Function get_outstanding_reference_documents() at erpnext.accounts.doctype.payment_entry.payment_entry.py is vulnerable to SQL Injection. It allows an attacker to extract arbitrary data from the database by injecting SQL payloads via the from_posting_date parameter, which is directly interpolated into the query without proper sanitization or parameter binding.",
