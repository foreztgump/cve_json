    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:thermal/netlink: Prevent userspace segmentation fault by adjusting UAPI headerThe intel-lpmd tool [1], which uses the THERMAL_GENL_ATTR_CPU_CAPABILITYattribute to receive HFI events from kernel space, encounters asegmentation fault after commit 1773572863c4 (\"thermal: netlink: Add thecommands and the events for the thresholds\").The issue arises because the THERMAL_GENL_ATTR_CPU_CAPABILITY raw valuewas changed while intel_lpmd still uses the old value.Although intel_lpmd can be updated to check the THERMAL_GENL_VERSION anduse the appropriate THERMAL_GENL_ATTR_CPU_CAPABILITY value, the commititself is questionable.The commit introduced a new element in the middle of enum thermal_genl_attr,which affects many existing attributes and introduces potential risksand unnecessary maintenance burdens for userspace thermal netlink eventusers.Solve the issue by moving the newly introducedTHERMAL_GENL_ATTR_TZ_PREV_TEMP attribute to the end of theenum thermal_genl_attr. This ensures that all existing thermal genericnetlink attributes remain unaffected.[ rjw: Subject edits ]",
