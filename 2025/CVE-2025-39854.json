    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ice: fix NULL access of tx->in_use in ice_ll_ts_intrRecent versions of the E810 firmware have support for an extra interrupt tohandle report of the \"low latency\" Tx timestamps coming from thespecialized low latency firmware interface. Instead of polling theregisters, software can wait until the low latency interrupt is fired.This logic makes use of the Tx timestamp tracking structure, ice_ptp_tx, asit uses the same \"ready\" bitmap to track which Tx timestamps complete.Unfortunately, the ice_ll_ts_intr() function does not check if thetracker is initialized before its first access. This results in NULLdereference or use-after-free bugs similar to the issues fixed in theice_ptp_ts_irq() function.Fix this by only checking the in_use bitmap (and other fields) if thetracker is marked as initialized. The reset flow will clear the init fieldunder lock before it tears the tracker down, thus preventing anyuse-after-free or NULL access.",
