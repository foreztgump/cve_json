        "CWE-754 Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions"
    ],
    "description": "An Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the routing protocol daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial-Of-Service (DoS).When an affected system receives a specific BGP EVPN update message over an established BGP session, this causes an rpd crash and restart.A BGP EVPN configuration is not necessary to be vulnerable. If peers are not configured to send BGP EVPN updates to a vulnerable device, then this issue can't occur.This issue affects iBGP and eBGP, over IPv4 and IPv6.This issue affects:Junos OS:  *  23.4 versions from 23.4R2-S3 before\u00c2\u00a023.4R2-S5,  *  24.2 versions from 24.2R2 before 24.2R2-S1,  *  24.4 versions before 24.4R1-S3, 24.4R2;Junos OS Evolved:  *  23.4-EVO versions from 23.4R2-S2-EVO before 23.4R2-S5-EVO,  *  24.2-EVO versions from 24.2R2-EVO before 24.2R2-S1-EVO,  *  24.4-EVO versions before 24.4R1-S3-EVO, 24.4R2-EVO.",
