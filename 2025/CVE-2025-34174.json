    "description": "In pfSense CE\u00c2\u00a0/usr/local/www/status_traffic_totals.php, the value of the start-day parameter is not ensured to be a numeric value or sanitized of HTML-related characters/strings before being directly displayed in the input box. This value can be saved as the default value to be displayed to all users when visiting the Status Traffic Totals page, resulting in stored cross-site scripting. The attacker must be authenticated with at least \"WebCfg - Status: Traffic Totals\" permissions.",
