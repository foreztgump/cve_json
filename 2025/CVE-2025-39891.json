    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:wifi: mwifiex: Initialize the chan_stats array to zeroThe adapter->chan_stats[] array is initialized inmwifiex_init_channel_scan_gap() with vmalloc(), which doesn't zero outmemory.  The array is filled in mwifiex_update_chan_statistics()and then the user can query the data in mwifiex_cfg80211_dump_survey().There are two potential issues here.  What if the user callsmwifiex_cfg80211_dump_survey() before the data has been filled in.Also the mwifiex_update_chan_statistics() function doesn't necessarilyinitialize the whole array.  Since the array was not initialized atthe start that could result in an information leak.Also this array is pretty small.  It's a maximum of 900 bytes so it'smore appropriate to use kcalloc() instead vmalloc().",
