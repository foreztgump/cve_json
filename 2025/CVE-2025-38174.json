    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:thunderbolt: Do not double dequeue a configuration requestSome of our devices crash in tb_cfg_request_dequeue(): general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address 0xdead000000000122 CPU: 6 PID: 91007 Comm: kworker/6:2 Tainted: G U W 6.6.65 RIP: 0010:tb_cfg_request_dequeue+0x2d/0xa0 Call Trace: <TASK> ? tb_cfg_request_dequeue+0x2d/0xa0 tb_cfg_request_work+0x33/0x80 worker_thread+0x386/0x8f0 kthread+0xed/0x110 ret_from_fork+0x38/0x50 ret_from_fork_asm+0x1b/0x30The circumstances are unclear, however, the theory is thattb_cfg_request_work() can be scheduled twice for a request:first time via frame.callback from ring_work() and secondtime from tb_cfg_request().  Both times kworkers will executetb_cfg_request_dequeue(), which results in double list_del()from the ctl->request_queue (the list poison deference hintsat it: 0xdead000000000122).Do not dequeue requests that don't have TB_CFG_REQUEST_ACTIVEbit set.",
