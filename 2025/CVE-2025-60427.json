    "description": "LibreTime 3.0.0-alpha.10 and possibly earlier is vulnerable to Broken Access Control, where a user with the DJ role can access analytics data via the Web UI and direct API calls. The backend does not verify role-based permissions for analytics endpoints, allowing unauthorized retrieval of station-wide metrics. This results in information disclosure to less privileged users.",
