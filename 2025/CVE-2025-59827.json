    "description": "Flag Forge is a Capture The Flag (CTF) platform. In version 2.1.0, the /api/admin/assign-badge endpoint lacks proper access control, allowing any authenticated user to assign high-privilege badges (e.g., Staff) to themselves. This could lead to privilege escalation and impersonation of administrative roles. This issue has been patched in version 2.2.0.",
