    "description": "md-to-pdf is a CLI tool for converting Markdown files to PDF using Node.js and headless Chrome. Prior to version 5.2.5, a Markdown front-matter block that contains JavaScript delimiter causes the JS engine in gray-matter library to execute arbitrary code in the Markdown to PDF converter process of md-to-pdf library, resulting in remote code execution. This issue has been patched in version 5.2.5.",
