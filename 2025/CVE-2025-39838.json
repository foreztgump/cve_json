    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:cifs: prevent NULL pointer dereference in UTF16 conversionThere can be a NULL pointer dereference bug here. NULL is passed to__cifs_sfu_make_node without checks, which passes it unchecked tocifs_strndup_to_utf16, which in turn passes it tocifs_local_to_utf16_bytes where '*from' is dereferenced, causing a crash.This patch adds a check for NULL 'src' in cifs_strndup_to_utf16 andreturns NULL early to prevent dereferencing NULL pointer.Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE",
