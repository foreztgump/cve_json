        "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
    ],
    "description": "The Media Player Addons for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'subtitle_ssize', 'track_title', and 'track_artist_name' parameters in version 1.0.5. This is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
