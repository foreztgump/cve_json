{"id": "CVE-2017-14173", "product": "n/a", "version": "n/a", "vulnerability": ["n/a"], "description": "In the function ReadTXTImage() in coders/txt.c in ImageMagick 7.0.6-10, an integer overflow might occur for the addition operation \"GetQuantumRange(depth)+1\" when \"depth\" is large, producing a smaller value than expected. As a result, an infinite loop would occur for a crafted TXT file that claims a very large \"max_value\" value.", "poc": {"reference": ["https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/issues/713"], "github": ["No PoCs found on GitHub currently."]}}
