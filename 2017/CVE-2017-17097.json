    "description": "gps-server.net GPS Tracking Software (self hosted) 2.x has a password reset procedure that immediately resets passwords upon an unauthenticated request, and then sends e-mail with a predictable (date-based) password to the admin, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain access by predicting this new password. This is related to the use of gmdate for password creation in fn_connect.php.",
