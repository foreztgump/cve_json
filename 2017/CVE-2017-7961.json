{"id": "CVE-2017-7961", "product": "n/a", "version": "n/a", "vulnerability": ["n/a"], "description": "** DISPUTED ** The cr_tknzr_parse_rgb function in cr-tknzr.c in libcroco 0.6.11 and 0.6.12 has an \"outside the range of representable values of type long\" undefined behavior issue, which might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted CSS file. NOTE: third-party analysis reports \"This is not a security issue in my view. The conversion surely is truncating the double into a long value, but there is no impact as the value is one of the RGB components.\"", "poc": {"reference": ["http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/04/24/2", "https://blogs.gentoo.org/ago/2017/04/17/libcroco-heap-overflow-and-undefined-behavior/", "https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1034482"], "github": ["https://github.com/andir/nixos-issue-db-example"]}}
