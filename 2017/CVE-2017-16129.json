    "product": "superagent node module",
    "version": "n/a",
    "vulnerability": [
        "Improper Handling of Highly Compressed Data (Data Amplification) (CWE-409)"
    ],
    "description": "The HTTP client module superagent is vulnerable to ZIP bomb attacks. In a ZIP bomb attack, the HTTP server replies with a compressed response that becomes several magnitudes larger once uncompressed. If a client does not take special care when processing such responses, it may result in excessive CPU and/or memory consumption. An attacker might exploit such a weakness for a DoS attack. To exploit this the attacker must control the location (URL) that superagent makes a request to.",
