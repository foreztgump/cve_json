    "description": "In writeToParcel and readFromParcel of PeriodicAdvertisingReport.java, there is a permission bypass due to a 64/32bit int mismatch. This could lead to a local escalation of privilege where the user can start an activity with system privileges, with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Product: Android. Versions: 8.0, 8.1. Android ID: A-69634768.",
