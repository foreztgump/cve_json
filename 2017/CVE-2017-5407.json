        "Pixel and history stealing via floating-point timing side channel with SVG filters"
    ],
    "description": "Using SVG filters that don't use the fixed point math implementation on a target iframe, a malicious page can extract pixel values from a targeted user. This can be used to extract history information and read text values across domains. This violates same-origin policy and leads to information disclosure.
