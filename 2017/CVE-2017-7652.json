If there are lots of clients connected so that there are no more file descriptors/sockets available (default limit typically 1024 file descriptors on Linux), then opening the configuration file will fail.", "poc": {"reference": ["https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=530102"], "github": ["https://github.com/andir/nixos-issue-db-example"]}}
