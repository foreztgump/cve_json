Normally the Proxy Auto-Config file is specified by the user or machine owner and presumed to be non-malicious, but if a user has enabled Web Proxy Auto Detect (WPAD) this file can be served remotely. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 51.", "poc": {"reference": ["https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1255474"], "github": ["https://github.com/ARPSyndicate/cvemon"]}}
