{"id": "CVE-2017-16618", "product": "n/a", "version": "n/a", "vulnerability": ["n/a"], "description": "An exploitable vulnerability exists in the YAML loading functionality of util.py in OwlMixin before 2.0.0a12. A \"Load YAML\" string or file (aka load_yaml or load_yamlf) can execute arbitrary Python commands resulting in command execution because load is used where safe_load should have been used. An attacker can insert Python into loaded YAML to trigger this vulnerability.", "poc": {"reference": ["https://github.com/tadashi-aikawa/owlmixin/issues/12", "https://joel-malwarebenchmark.github.io/blog/2017/11/08/cve-2017-16618-convert-through-owlmixin/"], "github": ["https://github.com/ARPSyndicate/cvemon"]}}
