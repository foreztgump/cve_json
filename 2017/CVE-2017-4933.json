{"id": "CVE-2017-4933", "product": "ESXi", "version": "n/a", "vulnerability": ["Heap overflow via authenticated VNC session"], "description": "VMware ESXi (6.5 before ESXi650-201710401-BG), Workstation (12.x before 12.5.8), and Fusion (8.x before 8.5.9) contain a vulnerability that could allow an authenticated VNC session to cause a heap overflow via a specific set of VNC packets resulting in heap corruption. Successful exploitation of this issue could result in remote code execution in a virtual machine via the authenticated VNC session. Note: In order for exploitation to be possible in ESXi, VNC must be manually enabled in a virtual machine's .vmx configuration file. In addition, ESXi must be configured to allow VNC traffic through the built-in firewall.", "poc": {"reference": ["No PoCs from references."], "github": ["https://github.com/ARPSyndicate/cvemon", "https://github.com/lnick2023/nicenice", "https://github.com/qazbnm456/awesome-cve-poc", "https://github.com/xbl3/awesome-cve-poc_qazbnm456"]}}
