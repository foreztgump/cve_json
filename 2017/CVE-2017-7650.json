    "vulnerability": [
        "loss of confidentiality"
    ],
    "description": "In Mosquitto before 1.4.12, pattern based ACLs can be bypassed by clients that set their username/client id to '#' or '+'. This allows locally or remotely connected clients to access MQTT topics that they do have the rights to. The same issue may be present in third party authentication/access control plugins for Mosquitto.",
