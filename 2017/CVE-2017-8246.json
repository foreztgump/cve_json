Later, prtd is freed. However, prtd is not sanitized and set to NULL, resulting in a dangling pointer. There are other functions that access the same memory (substream->runtime->private_data) with a NULL check, such as msm_pcm_volume_ctl_put(), which means this freed memory could be used.", "poc": {"reference": ["No PoCs from references."], "github": ["https://github.com/thdusdl1219/CVE-Study"]}}
