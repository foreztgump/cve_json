{"id": "CVE-2017-12842", "product": "n/a", "version": "n/a", "vulnerability": ["n/a"], "description": "Bitcoin Core before 0.14 allows an attacker to create an ostensibly valid SPV proof for a payment to a victim who uses an SPV wallet, even if that payment did not actually occur. Completing the attack would cost more than a million dollars, and is relevant mainly only in situations where an autonomous system relies solely on an SPV proof for transactions of a greater dollar amount.", "poc": {"reference": ["No PoCs from references."], "github": ["https://github.com/ARPSyndicate/cvemon", "https://github.com/nondejus/CVE-2017-12842", "https://github.com/uvhw/conchimgiangnang"]}}
