        "Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Generic (CWE-79)"
    ],
    "description": "i18next is a language translation framework. When using the .init method, passing interpolation options without passing an escapeValue will default to undefined rather than the assumed true. This can result in a cross-site scripting vulnerability because user input is assumed to be escaped, but is not. This vulnerability affects i18next 2.0.0 and later.",
