Parts of SysInfo require setuid-to-root access in order to access restricted system files and make restricted kernel calls. This access could be exploited by a local attacker to gain a root shell prompt using the right combination of environment variables and command line arguments.", "poc": {"reference": ["https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/44150/"], "github": ["No PoCs found on GitHub currently."]}}
