A data leak happens when these functions fill in sockaddr data structures used to export socket's diagnostic information. As a result, up to 100 bytes of the slab data could be leaked to a userspace.", "poc": {"reference": ["No PoCs from references."], "github": ["https://github.com/bcoles/kasld", "https://github.com/r3dxpl0it/Extreme-Exploit"]}}
