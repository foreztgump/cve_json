{"id": "CVE-2017-3184", "product": "ACTi D, B, I, and E series cameras", "version": "n/a", "vulnerability": ["CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function"], "description": "ACTi cameras including the D, B, I, and E series using firmware version A1D-500-V6.11.31-AC fail to properly restrict access to the factory reset page. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by directly accessing the http://x.x.x.x/setup/setup_maintain_firmware-default.html page. This will allow an attacker to perform a factory reset on the device, leading to a denial of service condition or the ability to make use of default credentials (CVE-2017-3186).", "poc": {"reference": ["https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/355151"], "github": ["No PoCs found on GitHub currently."]}}
