{"id": "CVE-2017-7781", "product": "Firefox", "version": "< 55 ", "vulnerability": ["Elliptic curve point addition error when using mixed Jacobian-affine coordinates"], "description": "An error occurs in the elliptic curve point addition algorithm that uses mixed Jacobian-affine coordinates where it can yield a result \"POINT_AT_INFINITY\" when it should not. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this to interfere with a connection, resulting in an attacked party computing an incorrect shared secret. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 55.", "poc": {"reference": ["https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1352039"], "github": ["https://github.com/ARPSyndicate/cvemon"]}}
