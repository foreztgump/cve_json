        "CWE-121 Stack-based Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "description": "LeapFTP <\u00a03.1.x contains a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in its FTP client parser. When the client receives a directory listing containing a filename longer than 528 bytes, the application fails to properly bound-check the input and overwrites the Structured Exception Handler (SEH) chain. This allows an attacker operating a malicious FTP server to execute arbitrary code on the victim\u2019s machine when the file is listed or downloaded.",
