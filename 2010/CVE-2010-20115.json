    "description": "Arcane Software\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Vermillion FTP Daemon (vftpd) versions up to and including 1.31 contains a memory corruption vulnerability triggered by a malformed FTP PORT command. The flaw arises from an out-of-bounds array access during input parsing, allowing an attacker to manipulate stack memory and potentially execute arbitrary code. Exploitation requires direct access to the FTP service and is constrained by a single execution attempt if the daemon is installed as a Windows service.",
