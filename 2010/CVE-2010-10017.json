    "description": "WM Downloader version 3.1.2.2 is vulnerable to a buffer overflow when processing a specially crafted .m3u playlist file. The application fails to properly validate input length, allowing an attacker to overwrite structured exception handler (SEH) records and execute arbitrary code. Exploitation occurs locally when a user opens the malicious file, and the payload executes with the privileges of the current user.",
