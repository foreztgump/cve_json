    "description": "The gfs2_dirent_find_space function in fs/gfs2/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.35 uses an incorrect size value in calculations associated with sentinel directory entries, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and panic) and possibly have unspecified other impact by renaming a file in a GFS2 filesystem, related to the gfs2_rename function in fs/gfs2/ops_inode.c.",
