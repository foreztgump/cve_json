        "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type"
    ],
    "description": "An unauthenticated arbitrary file upload vulnerability exists in Havalite CMS version 1.1.7 (and possibly earlier) in the upload.php script. The application fails to enforce proper file extension validation and authentication checks, allowing remote attackers to upload malicious PHP files via a crafted multipart/form-data POST request. Once uploaded, the attacker can access the file directly under havalite/tmp/files/, resulting in remote code execution.",
