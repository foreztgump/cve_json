        "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type"
    ],
    "description": "An unrestricted file upload vulnerability exists in MiniWeb HTTP Server <= Build 300 that allows unauthenticated remote attackers to upload arbitrary files to the server\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s filesystem. By abusing the upload handler and crafting a traversal path, an attacker can place a malicious .exe in system32, followed by a .mof file in the WMI directory. This triggers execution of the payload with SYSTEM privileges via the Windows Management Instrumentation service. The exploit is only viable on Windows versions prior to Vista.",
