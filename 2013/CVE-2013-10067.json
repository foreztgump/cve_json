        "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type"
    ],
    "description": "Glossword versions 1.8.8 through 1.8.12 contain an authenticated arbitrary file upload vulnerability. When deployed as a standalone application, the administrative interface (gw_admin.php) allows users with administrator privileges to upload files to the gw_temp/a/ directory. Due to insufficient validation of file type and path, attackers can upload and execute PHP payloads, resulting in remote code execution.",
