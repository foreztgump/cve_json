{"id": "CVE-2019-5611", "product": "FreeBSD", "version": "n/a", "vulnerability": ["Improper check for unusual conditions"], "description": "In FreeBSD 12.0-STABLE before r350828, 12.0-RELEASE before 12.0-RELEASE-p10, 11.3-STABLE before r350829, 11.3-RELEASE before 11.3-RELEASE-p3, and 11.2-RELEASE before 11.2-RELEASE-p14, a missing check in the function to arrange data in a chain of mbufs could cause data returned not to be contiguous. Extra checks in the IPv6 stack could catch the error condition and trigger a kernel panic, leading to a remote denial of service.", "poc": {"reference": ["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/154170/FreeBSD-Security-Advisory-FreeBSD-SA-19-22.mbuf.html"], "github": ["No PoCs found on GitHub currently."]}}
