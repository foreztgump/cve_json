    "product": "Ansible",
    "version": "all ansible_engine-2.x and ansible_engine-3.x up to ansible_engine-3.5 ",
    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-117",
        "CWE-532"
    ],
    "description": "In Ansible, all Ansible Engine versions up to ansible-engine 2.8.5, ansible-engine 2.7.13, ansible-engine 2.6.19, were logging at the DEBUG level which lead to a disclosure of credentials if a plugin used a library that logged credentials at the DEBUG level. This flaw does not affect Ansible modules, as those are executed in a separate process.",
