{"id": "CVE-2019-3843", "product": "systemd", "version": "n/a", "vulnerability": ["CWE-266"], "description": "It was discovered that a systemd service that uses DynamicUser property can create a SUID/SGID binary that would be allowed to run as the transient service UID/GID even after the service is terminated. A local attacker may use this flaw to access resources that will be owned by a potentially different service in the future, when the UID/GID will be recycled.", "poc": {"reference": ["No PoCs from references."], "github": ["https://github.com/PajakAlexandre/wik-dps-tp02", "https://github.com/garethr/snykout"]}}
