    "id": "CVE-2019-17563",
    "product": "Apache Tomcat",
    "version": "7.0.0 to 7.0.98 ",
    "vulnerability": [
        "Session fixation"
    ],
    "description": "When using FORM authentication with Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.29, 8.5.0 to 8.5.49 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.98 there was a narrow window where an attacker could perform a session fixation attack. The window was considered too narrow for an exploit to be practical but, erring on the side of caution, this issue has been treated as a security vulnerability.",
