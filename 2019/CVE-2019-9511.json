    "id": "CVE-2019-9511",
    "product": "n/a",
    "version": "n/a",
    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
    ],
    "description": "Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to window size manipulation and stream prioritization manipulation, potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker requests a large amount of data from a specified resource over multiple streams. They manipulate window size and stream priority to force the server to queue the data in 1-byte chunks. Depending on how efficiently this data is queued, this can consume excess CPU, memory, or both.",
