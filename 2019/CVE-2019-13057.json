{"id": "CVE-2019-13057", "product": "n/a", "version": "n/a", "vulnerability": ["n/a"], "description": "An issue was discovered in the server in OpenLDAP before 2.4.48. When the server administrator delegates rootDN (database admin) privileges for certain databases but wants to maintain isolation (e.g., for multi-tenant deployments), slapd does not properly stop a rootDN from requesting authorization as an identity from another database during a SASL bind or with a proxyAuthz (RFC 4370) control. (It is not a common configuration to deploy a system where the server administrator and a DB administrator enjoy different levels of trust.)", "poc": {"reference": ["https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2020.html", "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html"], "github": ["https://github.com/ARPSyndicate/cvemon"]}}
