        "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (XSS or 'Cross-site Scripting')"
    ],
    "description": "`sanitize-html` prior to version 2.0.0-beta is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS). The `sanitizeHtml()` function in `index.js` does not sanitize content when using the custom `transformTags` option, which is intended to convert attribute values into text. As a result, malicious input can be transformed into executable code.",
