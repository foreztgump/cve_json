    "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Integrated Management Controller (IMC) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack and perform arbitrary actions on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of the affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to follow a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use a web browser and the privileges of the user to perform arbitrary actions on the affected device.",
