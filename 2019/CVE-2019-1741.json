    "description": "A vulnerability in the Cisco Encrypted Traffic Analytics (ETA) feature of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to a logic error that exists when handling a malformed incoming packet, leading to access to an internal data structure after it has been freed. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted, malformed IP packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.",
