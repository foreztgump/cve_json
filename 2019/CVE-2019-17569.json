    "id": "CVE-2019-17569",
    "product": "Apache Tomcat",
    "version": "7.0.98 to 7.0.99 ",
    "vulnerability": [
        "HTTP Request Smuggling"
    ],
    "description": "The refactoring present in Apache Tomcat 9.0.28 to 9.0.30, 8.5.48 to 8.5.50 and 7.0.98 to 7.0.99 introduced a regression. The result of the regression was that invalid Transfer-Encoding headers were incorrectly processed leading to a possibility of HTTP Request Smuggling if Tomcat was located behind a reverse proxy that incorrectly handled the invalid Transfer-Encoding header in a particular manner. Such a reverse proxy is considered unlikely.",
