{
    "id": "CVE-2019-11744",
    "product": "Firefox ESR",
    "version": "< 60.9 ",
    "vulnerability": [
        "XSS by breaking out of title and textarea elements using innerHTML"
    ],
    "description": "Some HTML elements, such as &lt;title&gt; and &lt;textarea&gt;, can contain literal angle brackets without treating them as markup. It is possible to pass a literal closing tag to .innerHTML on these elements, and subsequent content after that will be parsed as if it were outside the tag. This can lead to XSS if a site does not filter user input as strictly for these elements as it does for other elements. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 69, Thunderbird < 68.1, Thunderbird < 60.9, Firefox ESR < 60.9, and Firefox ESR < 68.1.",
