An attacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code.", "poc": {"reference": ["https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2020.html", "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2020.html"], "github": ["https://github.com/ARPSyndicate/cvemon", "https://github.com/Anonymous-Phunter/PHunter", "https://github.com/CGCL-codes/PHunter", "https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-ide-vulscanner", "https://github.com/PalindromeLabs/Java-Deserialization-CVEs", "https://github.com/yahoo/cubed"]}}
