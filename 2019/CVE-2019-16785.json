{"id": "CVE-2019-16785", "product": "Waitress", "version": "<= 1.3.1<= 1.3.1 ", "vulnerability": ["CWE-444 Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request Smuggling')"], "description": "Waitress through version 1.3.1 implemented a \"MAY\" part of the RFC7230 which states: \"Although the line terminator for the start-line and header fields is the sequence CRLF, a recipient MAY recognize a single LF as a line terminator and ignore any preceding CR.\" Unfortunately if a front-end server does not parse header fields with an LF the same way as it does those with a CRLF it can lead to the front-end and the back-end server parsing the same HTTP message in two different ways. This can lead to a potential for HTTP request smuggling/splitting whereby Waitress may see two requests while the front-end server only sees a single HTTP message. This issue is fixed in Waitress 1.4.0.", "poc": {"reference": ["https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html"], "github": ["https://github.com/Live-Hack-CVE/CVE-2019-16785"]}}
