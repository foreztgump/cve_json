This affects the development mode error handler when an exception message contains untrusted data. Note the production mode error handler is not vulnerable - so for this to be utilized in production it would require users to not disable development mode.", "poc": {"reference": ["https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-IORATPACK-534882"], "github": ["No PoCs found on GitHub currently."]}}
