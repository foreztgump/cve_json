{"id": "CVE-2019-5605", "product": "FreeBSD", "version": "n/a", "vulnerability": ["Kernel information exposure"], "description": "In FreeBSD 11.3-STABLE before r350217, 11.3-RELEASE before 11.3-RELEASE-p1, and 11.2-RELEASE before 11.2-RELEASE-p12, due to insufficient initialization of memory copied to userland in the freebsd32_ioctl interface, small amounts of kernel memory may be disclosed to userland processes. This may allow an attacker to leverage this information to obtain elevated privileges either directly or indirectly.", "poc": {"reference": ["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/153749/FreeBSD-Security-Advisory-FreeBSD-SA-19-14.freebsd32.html"], "github": ["No PoCs found on GitHub currently."]}}
