There is a stack exhaustion problem caused by the expr6 function making recursive calls to itself in certain scenarios involving lots of '!' or '+' or '-' characters. Remote attackers could leverage this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service via a crafted asm file.", "poc": {"reference": ["https://bugzilla.nasm.us/show_bug.cgi?id=3392549"], "github": ["https://github.com/ICSE2020-MemLock/MemLock_Benchmark", "https://github.com/SZU-SE/MemLock_Benchmark", "https://github.com/SZU-SE/Stack-overflow-Fuzzer-TestSuite", "https://github.com/fuzz-evaluator/MemLock-Fuzz-eval", "https://github.com/tzf-key/MemLock_Benchmark", "https://github.com/tzf-omkey/MemLock_Benchmark", "https://github.com/wcventure/MemLock-Fuzz", "https://github.com/wcventure/MemLock_Benchmark"]}}
