    "description": "In CentOS-WebPanel.com (aka CWP) CentOS Web Panel 0.9.8.838 to 0.9.8.846, remote attackers can bypass authentication in the login process by leveraging the knowledge of a valid username. The attacker must defeat an encoding that is not equivalent to base64, and thus this is different from CVE-2019-13360.",
