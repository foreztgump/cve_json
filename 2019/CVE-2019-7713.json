There is a heap-based buffer overflow in the function responsible for printing the shell prompt, when a custom modifier is used to display information such as a process ID, IP address, or current working directory. Modifier expansion triggers this overflow, causing memory corruption or a crash (and also leaks memory address information).", "poc": {"reference": ["No PoCs from references."], "github": ["https://github.com/AlixAbbasi/GHS-Bugs", "https://github.com/bl4ckic3/GHS-Bugs"]}}
