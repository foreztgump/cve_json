The root_runner.64 binary is setuid root. This binary executes /opt/pia/ruby/64/ruby, which in turn attempts to load several libraries under /tmp/ruby-deploy.old/lib. A local unprivileged user can create a malicious library under this path to execute arbitrary code as the root user.", "poc": {"reference": ["No PoCs from references."], "github": ["https://github.com/mirchr/security-research"]}}
