{"id": "CVE-2019-14760", "product": "n/a", "version": "n/a", "vulnerability": ["n/a"], "description": "An issue was discovered in KaiOS 2.5. The pre-installed Recorder application is vulnerable to HTML and JavaScript injection attacks. A local attacker can inject arbitrary HTML into the Recorder application. At a bare minimum, this allows an attacker to take control over the Recorder application's UI (e.g., display a malicious prompt to the user asking them to re-enter credentials such as their KaiOS credentials to continue using the application) and also allows an attacker to abuse any of the privileges available to the mobile application.", "poc": {"reference": ["https://research.nccgroup.com/2020/08/21/technical-advisory-multiple-html-injection-vulnerabilities-in-kaios-pre-installed-mobile-applications/"], "github": ["No PoCs found on GitHub currently."]}}
