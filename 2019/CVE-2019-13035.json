{"id": "CVE-2019-13035", "product": "n/a", "version": "n/a", "vulnerability": ["n/a"], "description": "Artica Pandora FMS 7.0 NG before 735 suffers from local privilege escalation due to improper permissions on C:\\PandoraFMS and its sub-folders, allowing standard users to create new files. Moreover, the Apache service httpd.exe will try to execute cmd.exe from C:\\PandoraFMS (the current directory) as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM upon web requests to the portal. This will effectively allow non-privileged users to escalate privileges to NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM.", "poc": {"reference": ["https://github.com/active-labs/Advisories/blob/master/2019/ACTIVE-2019-008.md"], "github": ["No PoCs found on GitHub currently."]}}
