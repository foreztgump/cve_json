It does not properly mitigate against unsafe characters in serialized regular expressions. This vulnerability is not affected on Node.js environment since Node.js's implementation of RegExp.prototype.toString() backslash-escapes all forward slashes in regular expressions. If serialized data of regular expression objects are used in an environment other than Node.js, it is affected by this vulnerability.", "poc": {"reference": ["No PoCs from references."], "github": ["https://github.com/ossf-cve-benchmark/CVE-2019-16769", "https://github.com/ray-tracer96024/Unintentionally-Vulnerable-Hotel-Management-Website", "https://github.com/seal-community/patches"]}}
