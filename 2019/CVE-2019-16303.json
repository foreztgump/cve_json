This allows an attacker (if able to obtain their own password reset URL) to compute the value for all other password resets for other accounts, thus allowing privilege escalation or account takeover.", "poc": {"reference": ["https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/10401", "https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-kotlin/issues/183"], "github": ["https://github.com/JLLeitschuh/bulk-security-pr-generator"]}}
