Each sockets will be waited by the worker for at most 'ioblocktimeout' seconds. However this timeout applies only for un-encrypted requests. Connections using SSL/TLS are not taking this timeout into account during reads, and may hang longer.An unauthenticated attacker could repeatedly create hanging LDAP requests to hang all the workers, resulting in a Denial of Service.", "poc": {"reference": ["https://pagure.io/389-ds-base/issue/50329"], "github": ["No PoCs found on GitHub currently."]}}
