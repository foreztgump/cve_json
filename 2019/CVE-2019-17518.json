    "description": "The Bluetooth Low Energy implementation on Dialog Semiconductor SDK through 1.0.14.1081 for DA1468x devices responds to link layer packets with a payload length larger than expected, allowing attackers in radio range to cause a buffer overflow via a crafted packet. This affects, for example, August Smart Lock.",
