    "description": "inxedu through 2018-12-24 has a SQL Injection vulnerability that can lead to information disclosure via the deleteFaveorite/ PATH_INFO. The vulnerable code location is com.inxedu.os.edu.controller.user.UserController#deleteFavorite (aka deleteFavorite in com/inxedu/os/edu/controller/user/UserController.java), where courseFavoritesService.deleteCourseFavoritesById is mishandled during use of MyBatis. NOTE: UserController.java has a spelling variation in an annotation: a @RequestMapping(\"/deleteFaveorite/{ids}\") line followed by a \"public ModelAndView deleteFavorite\" line.",
