{"id": "CVE-2019-12083", "product": "n/a", "version": "n/a", "vulnerability": ["n/a"], "description": "The Rust Programming Language Standard Library 1.34.x before 1.34.2 contains a stabilized method which, if overridden, can violate Rust's safety guarantees and cause memory unsafety. If the `Error::type_id` method is overridden then any type can be safely cast to any other type, causing memory safety vulnerabilities in safe code (e.g., out-of-bounds write or read). Code that does not manually implement Error::type_id is unaffected.", "poc": {"reference": ["No PoCs from references."], "github": ["https://github.com/Artisan-Lab/Rust-memory-safety-bugs", "https://github.com/Qwaz/rust-cve", "https://github.com/xxg1413/rust-security"]}}
