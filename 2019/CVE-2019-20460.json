    "description": "An issue was discovered on Epson Expression Home XP255 20.08.FM10I8 devices. POST requests don't require (anti-)CSRF tokens or other mechanisms for validating that the request is from a legitimate source. In addition, CSRF attacks can be used to send text directly to the RAW printer interface. For example, an attack could deliver a worrisome printout to an end user.",
