However, due to lack of validation from the parent process, if the user accepted the permission request an attacker-controlled permission would be granted rather than the 'Click to Play' permission. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 70.", "poc": {"reference": ["https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1562582"], "github": ["No PoCs found on GitHub currently."]}}
