    "description": "** DISPUTED **  Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in Modules Builder (modbuild) 4.1 for Comdev One Admin allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the path[docroot] parameter to (1) config-bak.php or (2) config.php.  NOTE: CVE disputes this vulnerability because the unmodified scripts set the applicable variable to the empty string; reasonable modified copies would use a fixed pathname string.",
