    "description": "The (1) NSID_SHUFFLE_ONLY and (2) NSID_USE_POOL PRNG algorithms in ISC BIND 8 before 8.4.7-P1 generate predictable DNS query identifiers when sending outgoing queries such as NOTIFY messages when answering questions as a resolver, which allows remote attackers to poison DNS caches via unknown vectors.  NOTE: this issue is different from CVE-2007-2926.",
