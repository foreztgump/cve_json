    "description": "The embedded Internet Explorer server control in AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) 6.1.41.2 and 6.2.32.1, AIM Pro, and AIM Lite does not properly constrain the use of mshtml.dll's web script and HTML functionality for incoming instant messages, which allows remote attackers to place HTML into unexpected contexts or execute arbitrary code, as demonstrated by writing arbitrary HTML to a notification window, and writing contents of arbitrary local image files to this window via IMG SRC.",
