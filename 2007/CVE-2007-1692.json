{"id": "CVE-2007-1692", "product": "n/a", "version": "n/a", "vulnerability": ["n/a"], "description": "The default configuration of Microsoft Windows uses the Web Proxy Autodiscovery Protocol (WPAD) without static WPAD entries, which might allow remote attackers to intercept web traffic by registering a proxy server using WINS or DNS, then responding to WPAD requests, as demonstrated using Internet Explorer.  NOTE: it could be argued that if an attacker already has control over WINS/DNS, then web traffic could already be intercepted by modifying WINS or DNS records, so this would not cross privilege boundaries and would not be a vulnerability.  It has also been reported that DHCP is an alternate attack vector.", "poc": {"reference": ["http://isc.sans.org/diary.html?storyid=2517"], "github": ["No PoCs found on GitHub currently."]}}
