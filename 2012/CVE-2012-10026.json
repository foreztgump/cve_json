        "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type"

    "description": "The WordPress plugin Asset-Manager version 2.0 and below contains an unauthenticated arbitrary file upload vulnerability in upload.php. The endpoint fails to properly validate and restrict uploaded file types, allowing remote attackers to upload malicious PHP scripts to a predictable temporary directory. Once uploaded, the attacker can execute the file via a direct HTTP GET request, resulting in remote code execution under the web server\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s context.",
