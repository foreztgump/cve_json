    "description": "Moxa EDR-G903 series routers with firmware before 2.11 do not use a sufficient source of entropy for (1) SSH and (2) SSL keys, which makes it easier for man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof a device or modify a client-server data stream by leveraging knowledge of a key from a product installation elsewhere.",
