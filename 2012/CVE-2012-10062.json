    "description": "A vulnerability in XAMPP, developed by Apache Friends, version 1.7.3's default WebDAV configuration allows remote authenticated attackers to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code. The WebDAV service, accessible via /webdav/, accepts HTTP PUT requests using default credentials. This permits attackers to upload a malicious PHP payload and trigger its execution via a subsequent GET request, resulting in remote code execution on the server.",
