    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-134 Use of Externally-Controlled Format String"
    ],
    "description": "ComSndFTP FTP Server version 1.3.7 Beta contains a format string vulnerability in its handling of the USER command. By sending a specially crafted username containing format specifiers, a remote attacker can overwrite a hardcoded function pointer in memory (specifically WSACleanup from Ws2_32.dll). This allows the attacker to redirect execution flow and bypass DEP protections using a ROP chain, ultimately leading to arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability is exploitable without authentication and affects default configurations.",
