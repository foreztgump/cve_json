        "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type"
    ],
    "description": "Project Pier 0.8.8 and earlier contains an unauthenticated arbitrary file upload vulnerability in tools/upload_file.php. The upload handler fails to validate the file type or enforce authentication, allowing remote attackers to upload malicious PHP files directly into a web-accessible directory. The uploaded file is stored with a predictable suffix\u00c2\u00a0and can be executed by requesting its URL, resulting in remote code execution.",
