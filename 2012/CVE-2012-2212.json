NOTE: this issue might not be reproducible, because the researcher did not provide configuration details for the vulnerable system, and the observed behavior might be consistent with a configuration that was (perhaps inadvertently) designed to allow access based on Host HTTP headers.", "poc": {"reference": ["No PoCs from references."], "github": ["https://github.com/claudijd/proxy_bypass"]}}
