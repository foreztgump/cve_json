    "description": "ClanSphere 2011.3 is vulnerable to a local file inclusion (LFI) flaw due to improper handling of the cs_lang cookie parameter. The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input, allowing attackers to traverse directories and read arbitrary files outside the web root. The vulnerability is further exacerbated by null byte injection (%00) to bypass file extension checks.",
