    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type"
    ],
    "description": "PHP Volunteer Management System v1.0.2 contains an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in its document upload functionality. Authenticated users can upload files to the mods/documents/uploads/ directory without any restriction on file type or extension. Because this directory is publicly accessible and lacks execution controls, attackers can upload a malicious PHP payload and execute it remotely. The application ships with default credentials, making exploitation trivial. Once authenticated, the attacker can upload a PHP shell and trigger it via a direct GET request.",
