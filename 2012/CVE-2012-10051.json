    "description": "Photodex ProShow Producer version 5.0.3256 contains a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the handling of plugin load list files. When a specially crafted load file is placed in the installation directory, the application fails to properly validate its contents, leading to a buffer overflow when the file is parsed during startup. Exploitation requires local access to place the file and user interaction to launch the application.",
