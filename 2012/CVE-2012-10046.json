    "description": "The E-Mail Security Virtual Appliance (ESVA) (tested on version ESVA_2057) contains an unauthenticated command injection vulnerability in the learn-msg.cgi script. The CGI handler fails to sanitize user-supplied input passed via the id parameter, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary shell commands. Exploitation requires no authentication and results in full command execution on the underlying system.",
