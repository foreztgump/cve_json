    "id": "CVE-2012-10032",
    "product": "Maxthon3 Browser",
    "version": "3.1.7 build 600 ",
    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (XSS or 'Cross-site Scripting')",
        "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')"
    ],
    "description": "Maxthon3 versions prior to 3.3 are vulnerable to cross context scripting (XCS) via the about:history page. The browser\u2019s trusted zone improperly handles injected script content, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in a privileged context. This flaw enables modification of browser configuration and execution of arbitrary code through Maxthon\u2019s exposed DOM APIs, including maxthon.program.Program.launch() and maxthon.io.writeDataURL(). Exploitation requires user interaction, typically by visiting a malicious webpage that triggers the injection.",
