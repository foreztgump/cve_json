NOTE: this issue might not be reproducible, because the researcher is unable to provide a squid.conf file for a vulnerable system, and the observed behavior is consistent with a squid.conf file that was (perhaps inadvertently) designed to allow access based on a \"req_header Host\" acl regex that matches www.uol.com.br.", "poc": {"reference": ["No PoCs from references."], "github": ["https://github.com/claudijd/proxy_bypass"]}}
