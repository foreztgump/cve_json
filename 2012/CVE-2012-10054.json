        "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type"
    ],
    "description": "Umbraco CMS versions prior to 4.7.1 are vulnerable to unauthenticated remote code execution via the codeEditorSave.asmx SOAP endpoint, which exposes a SaveDLRScript operation that permits arbitrary file uploads without authentication. By exploiting a path traversal flaw in the fileName parameter, attackers can write malicious ASPX scripts directly into the web-accessible /umbraco/ directory and execute them remotely.",
