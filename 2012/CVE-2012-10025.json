    "description": "The WordPress plugin Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) version 3.5.1 and below contains a remote file inclusion (RFI) vulnerability in core/actions/export.php. When the PHP configuration directive allow_url_include is enabled (default: Off), an unauthenticated attacker can exploit the acf_abspath POST parameter to include and execute arbitrary remote PHP code. This leads to remote code execution under the web server\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s context, allowing full compromise of the host.",
