    "description": "** DISPUTED ** Bitwarden through 2023.2.1 offers password auto-fill within a cross-domain IFRAME element. NOTE: the vendor's position is that there have been important legitimate cross-domain configurations (e.g., an apple.com IFRAME element on the icloud.com website) and that \"Auto-fill on page load\" is not enabled by default.",
