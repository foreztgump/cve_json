{"id": "CVE-2018-8018", "product": "Apache Ignite", "version": "n/a", "vulnerability": ["Information Disclosure"], "description": "In Apache Ignite before 2.4.8 and 2.5.x before 2.5.3, the serialization mechanism does not have a list of classes allowed for serialization/deserialization, which makes it possible to run arbitrary code when 3-rd party vulnerable classes are present in Ignite classpath. The vulnerability can be exploited if the one sends a specially prepared form of a serialized object to GridClientJdkMarshaller deserialization endpoint.", "poc": {"reference": ["No PoCs from references."], "github": ["https://github.com/ARPSyndicate/cvemon", "https://github.com/AdeliaNitzsche/Java-Deserialization-Cheat-Sheet", "https://github.com/GrrrDog/Java-Deserialization-Cheat-Sheet", "https://github.com/PalindromeLabs/Java-Deserialization-CVEs", "https://github.com/mishmashclone/GrrrDog-Java-Deserialization-Cheat-Sheet"]}}
