    "product": "BIND 9",
    "version": "n/a",
    "vulnerability": [
        "Servers running a vulnerable version of BIND (9.12.0, 9.12.1) which permit recursion to clients and which have the max-stale-ttl parameter set to a non-zero value are at risk."
    ],
    "description": "A problem with the implementation of the new serve-stale feature in BIND 9.12 can lead to an assertion failure in rbtdb.c, even when stale-answer-enable is off. Additionally, problematic interaction between the serve-stale feature and NSEC aggressive negative caching can in some cases cause undesirable behavior from named, such as a recursion loop or excessive logging. Deliberate exploitation of this condition could cause operational problems depending on the particular manifestation -- either degradation or denial of service. Affects BIND 9.12.0 and 9.12.1.",
