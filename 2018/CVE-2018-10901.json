{"id": "CVE-2018-10901", "product": "kernel:", "version": "n/a", "vulnerability": ["CWE-665"], "description": "A flaw was found in Linux kernel's KVM virtualization subsystem. The VMX code does not restore the GDT.LIMIT to the previous host value, but instead sets it to 64KB. With a corrupted GDT limit a host's userspace code has an ability to place malicious entries in the GDT, particularly to the per-cpu variables. An attacker can use this to escalate their privileges.", "poc": {"reference": ["https://help.ecostruxureit.com/display/public/UADCE725/Security+fixes+in+StruxureWare+Data+Center+Expert+v7.6.0", "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2020.html"], "github": ["No PoCs found on GitHub currently."]}}
