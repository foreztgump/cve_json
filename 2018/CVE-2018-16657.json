{"id": "CVE-2018-16657", "product": "n/a", "version": "n/a", "vulnerability": ["n/a"], "description": "In Kamailio before 5.0.7 and 5.1.x before 5.1.4, a crafted SIP message with an invalid Via header causes a segmentation fault and crashes Kamailio. The reason is missing input validation in the crcitt_string_array core function for calculating a CRC hash for To tags. (An additional error is present in the check_via_address core function: this function also misses input validation.) This could result in denial of service and potentially the execution of arbitrary code.", "poc": {"reference": ["No PoCs from references."], "github": ["https://github.com/ARPSyndicate/cvemon"]}}
