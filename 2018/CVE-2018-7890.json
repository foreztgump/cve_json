    "description": "A remote code execution issue was discovered in Zoho ManageEngine Applications Manager before 13.6 (build 13640). The publicly accessible testCredential.do endpoint takes multiple user inputs and validates supplied credentials by accessing a specified system. This endpoint calls several internal classes, and then executes a PowerShell script. If the specified system is OfficeSharePointServer, then the username and password parameters to this script are not validated, leading to Command Injection.",
