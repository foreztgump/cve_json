The application's add user functionality suffers from CSRF. A malicious user can craft an HTML page and use it to trick a victim into clicking on it; once executed, a malicious user will be created with admin privileges. This happens due to lack of an anti-CSRF token in state modification requests.", "poc": {"reference": ["https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/44383/"], "github": ["No PoCs found on GitHub currently."]}}
