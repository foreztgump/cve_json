Out-of-bounds writes can occur because ParseDsdiffHeaderConfig in dsdiff.c does not validate the sizes of unknown chunks before attempting memory allocation, related to a lack of integer-overflow protection within a bytes_to_copy calculation and subsequent malloc call, leading to insufficient memory allocation.", "poc": {"reference": ["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/155743/Slackware-Security-Advisory-wavpack-Updates.html"], "github": ["https://github.com/aflsmart/aflsmart", "https://github.com/andir/nixos-issue-db-example"]}}
