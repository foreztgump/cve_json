{"id": "CVE-2018-12384", "product": "Network Security Services (NSS)", "version": "n/a", "vulnerability": ["Use of Insufficiently Random Values"], "description": "When handling a SSLv2-compatible ClientHello request, the server doesn't generate a new random value but sends an all-zero value instead. This results in full malleability of the ClientHello for SSLv2 used for TLS 1.2 in all versions prior to NSS 3.39. This does not impact TLS 1.3.", "poc": {"reference": ["https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuoct2019-5072832.html"], "github": ["https://github.com/rjrelyea/ca-certificate-scripts"]}}
