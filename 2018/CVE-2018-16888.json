{"id": "CVE-2018-16888", "product": "systemd", "version": "n/a", "vulnerability": ["CWE-250"], "description": "It was discovered systemd does not correctly check the content of PIDFile files before using it to kill processes. When a service is run from an unprivileged user (e.g. User field set in the service file), a local attacker who is able to write to the PIDFile of the mentioned service may use this flaw to trick systemd into killing other services and/or privileged processes. Versions before v237 are vulnerable.", "poc": {"reference": ["No PoCs from references."], "github": ["https://github.com/flyrev/security-scan-ci-presentation", "https://github.com/hpcprofessional/remediate_cesa_2019_2091"]}}
