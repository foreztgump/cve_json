{"id": "CVE-2018-1283", "product": "Apache HTTP Server", "version": "n/a", "vulnerability": ["Tampering of mod_session data for CGI applications."], "description": "In Apache httpd 2.4.0 to 2.4.29, when mod_session is configured to forward its session data to CGI applications (SessionEnv on, not the default), a remote user may influence their content by using a \"Session\" header. This comes from the \"HTTP_SESSION\" variable name used by mod_session to forward its data to CGIs, since the prefix \"HTTP_\" is also used by the Apache HTTP Server to pass HTTP header fields, per CGI specifications.", "poc": {"reference": ["No PoCs from references."], "github": ["https://github.com/ARPSyndicate/cvemon", "https://github.com/PawanKumarPandit/Shodan-nrich", "https://github.com/RoseSecurity-Research/Red-Teaming-TTPs", "https://github.com/RoseSecurity/Red-Teaming-TTPs", "https://github.com/austin-lai/External-Penetration-Testing-Holo-Corporate-Network-TryHackMe-Holo-Network", "https://github.com/benoitsevres/north-dakota", "https://github.com/bioly230/THM_Skynet", "https://github.com/firatesatoglu/shodanSearch", "https://github.com/retr0-13/nrich", "https://github.com/rnbochsr/yr_of_the_jellyfish", "https://github.com/vshaliii/Basic-Pentesting-2-Vulnhub-Walkthrough", "https://github.com/vshaliii/DC-2-Vulnhub-Walkthrough", "https://github.com/vshaliii/DC-3-Vulnhub-Walkthrough", "https://github.com/vshaliii/Funbox2-rookie"]}}
