The default configuration also allows operator users to execute the pppd binary with elevated (sudo) permissions. Certain input parameters are not properly validated. A malicious operator user can run the binary with elevated permissions and leverage its improper input validation condition to spawn an attacker-controlled shell with root privileges.", "poc": {"reference": ["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/159234/VyOS-restricted-shell-Escape-Privilege-Escalation.html", "https://blog.mirch.io/2018/11/05/cve-2018-18556-vyos-privilege-escalation-via-sudo-pppd-for-operator-users/", "https://blog.vyos.io/the-operator-level-is-proved-insecure-and-will-be-removed-in-the-next-releases"], "github": ["https://github.com/ARPSyndicate/cvemon", "https://github.com/mirchr/security-research"]}}
