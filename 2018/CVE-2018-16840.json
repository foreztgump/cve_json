{"id": "CVE-2018-16840", "product": "curl", "version": "n/a", "vulnerability": ["CWE-416"], "description": "A heap use-after-free flaw was found in curl versions from 7.59.0 through 7.61.1 in the code related to closing an easy handle. When closing and cleaning up an 'easy' handle in the `Curl_close()` function, the library code first frees a struct (without nulling the pointer) and might then subsequently erroneously write to a struct field within that already freed struct.", "poc": {"reference": ["No PoCs from references."], "github": ["https://github.com/KorayAgaya/TrivyWeb", "https://github.com/Mohzeela/external-secret", "https://github.com/siddharthraopotukuchi/trivy", "https://github.com/simiyo/trivy", "https://github.com/t31m0/Vulnerability-Scanner-for-Containers", "https://github.com/umahari/security"]}}
