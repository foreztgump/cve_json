In the SetRouterSettings.php source code, the RemotePort parameter is saved in the $path_inf_wan1.\"/web\" internal configuration memory without any regex checking. And in the IPTWAN_build_command function of the iptwan.php source code, the data in $path_inf_wan1.\"/web\" is used with the iptables command without any regex checking. A vulnerable /HNAP1/SetRouterSettings XML message could have shell metacharacters in the RemotePort element such as the `telnetd` string.",
