        "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')"
    ],
    "description": "D-Link DNS-343 ShareCenter devices running firmware versions up to and including 1.05 contain a command injection vulnerability in the Mail Test functionality. The web maintenance script posts to the internal goForm endpoint '/goform/Mail_Test' and uses several form parameters directly in a call to a system email utility without proper input validation. An unauthenticated remote attacker can supply crafted form data that injects shell commands, resulting in execution as root on the device. NOTE: The DNS-343 product line has been declared end-of-life.",
