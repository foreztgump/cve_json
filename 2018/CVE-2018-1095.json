    "id": "CVE-2018-1095",
    "product": "Linux kernel through version 4.15",
    "version": "Linux kernel through version 4.15 ",
    "vulnerability": [
        "NULL pointer dereference"
    ],
    "description": "The ext4_xattr_check_entries function in fs/ext4/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 4.15.15 does not properly validate xattr sizes, which causes misinterpretation of a size as an error code, and consequently allows attackers to cause a denial of service (get_acl NULL pointer dereference and system crash) via a crafted ext4 image.",
