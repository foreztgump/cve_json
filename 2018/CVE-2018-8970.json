{"id": "CVE-2018-8970", "product": "n/a", "version": "n/a", "vulnerability": ["n/a"], "description": "The int_x509_param_set_hosts function in lib/libcrypto/x509/x509_vpm.c in LibreSSL 2.7.0 before 2.7.1 does not support a certain special case of a zero name length, which causes silent omission of hostname verification, and consequently allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof servers and obtain sensitive information via a crafted certificate. NOTE: the LibreSSL documentation indicates that this special case is supported, but the BoringSSL documentation does not.", "poc": {"reference": ["https://hackerone.com/reports/329645"], "github": ["https://github.com/0xT11/CVE-POC", "https://github.com/hectorgie/PoC-in-GitHub", "https://github.com/tiran/CVE-2018-8970"]}}
