    "id": "CVE-2016-9121",
    "product": "Go JOSE All versions before 1.0.4",
    "version": "n/a",
    "vulnerability": [
        "Cryptographic Issue"
    ],
    "description": "go-jose before 1.0.4 suffers from an invalid curve attack for the ECDH-ES algorithm. When deriving a shared key using ECDH-ES for an encrypted message, go-jose neglected to check that the received public key on a message is on the same curve as the static private key of the receiver, thus making it vulnerable to an invalid curve attack.",
