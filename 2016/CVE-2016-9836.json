CMS before 3.6.5 does not consider alternative PHP file extensions when checking uploaded files for PHP content, which enables a user to upload and execute files with the `.php6`, `.php7`, `.phtml`, and `.phpt` extensions. Additionally, JHelperMedia::canUpload() did not blacklist these file extensions as uploadable file types.", "poc": {"reference": ["https://github.com/XiphosResearch/exploits/tree/master/Joomraa"], "github": ["https://github.com/R0B1NL1N/E-x-p-l-o-i-t-s", "https://github.com/Xcod3bughunt3r/ExploitsTools", "https://github.com/XiphosResearch/exploits", "https://github.com/dr4v/exploits", "https://github.com/shildenbrand/Exploits"]}}
