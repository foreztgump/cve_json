    "description": "The __get_user_asm_ex macro in arch/x86/include/asm/uaccess.h in the Linux kernel 4.4.22 through 4.4.28 contains extended asm statements that are incompatible with the exception table, which allows local users to obtain root access on non-SMEP platforms via a crafted application.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of incorrect backporting of the CVE-2016-9178 patch to older kernels.",
