{"id": "CVE-2016-9847", "product": "n/a", "version": "n/a", "vulnerability": ["n/a"], "description": "An issue was discovered in phpMyAdmin. When the user does not specify a blowfish_secret key for encrypting cookies, phpMyAdmin generates one at runtime. A vulnerability was reported where the way this value is created uses a weak algorithm. This could allow an attacker to determine the user's blowfish_secret and potentially decrypt their cookies. All 4.6.x versions (prior to 4.6.5), 4.4.x versions (prior to 4.4.15.9), and 4.0.x versions (prior to 4.0.10.18) are affected.", "poc": {"reference": ["https://www.phpmyadmin.net/security/PMASA-2016-58"], "github": ["No PoCs found on GitHub currently."]}}
