{"id": "CVE-2016-10728", "product": "n/a", "version": "n/a", "vulnerability": ["n/a"], "description": "An issue was discovered in Suricata before 3.1.2. If an ICMPv4 error packet is received as the first packet on a flow in the to_client direction, it confuses the rule grouping lookup logic. The toclient inspection will then continue with the wrong rule group. This can lead to missed detection.", "poc": {"reference": ["https://github.com/kirillwow/ids_bypass"], "github": ["https://github.com/kirillwow/ids_bypass"]}}
