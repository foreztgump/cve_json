    "description": "The eap_pwd_process function in eap_peer/eap_pwd.c in wpa_supplicant 2.x before 2.6 does not validate that the reassembly buffer is large enough for the final fragment when EAP-pwd is enabled in a network configuration profile, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (process termination) via a large final fragment in an EAP-pwd message.",
