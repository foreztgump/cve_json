    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:locking/csd_lock: Change csdlock_debug from early_param to __setupThe csdlock_debug kernel-boot parameter is parsed by theearly_param() function csdlock_debug().  If set, csdlock_debug()invokes static_branch_enable() to enable csd_lock_wait feature, whichtriggers a panic on arm64 for kernels built with CONFIG_SPARSEMEM=y andCONFIG_SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP=n.With CONFIG_SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP=n, __nr_to_section is called instatic_key_enable() and returns NULL, resulting in a NULL dereferencebecause mem_section is initialized only later in sparse_init().This is also a problem for powerpc because early_param() functionsare invoked earlier than jump_label_init(), also resulting instatic_key_enable() failures.  These failures cause the warning \"statickey 'xxx' used before call to jump_label_init()\".Thus, early_param is too early for csd_lock_wait to runstatic_branch_enable(), so changes it to __setup to fix these.",
