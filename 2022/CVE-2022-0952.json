As a result, unauthenticated attackers could change arbitrary blog options, such as the users_can_register and default_role, allowing them to create a new admin account and take over the blog.", "poc": {"reference": ["No PoCs from references."], "github": ["https://github.com/ARPSyndicate/cvemon", "https://github.com/ARPSyndicate/kenzer-templates", "https://github.com/RandomRobbieBF/CVE-2022-0952", "https://github.com/nomi-sec/PoC-in-GitHub"]}}
