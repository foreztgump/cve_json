    "vulnerability": [
        "Prototype Pollution"
    ],
    "description": "All versions of package dset are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution via 'dset/merge' mode, as the dset function checks for prototype pollution by validating if the top-level path contains __proto__, constructor or protorype. By crafting a malicious object, it is possible to bypass this check and achieve prototype pollution.",
