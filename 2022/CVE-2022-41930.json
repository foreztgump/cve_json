    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-862: Missing Authorization"
    ],
    "description": "org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-user-profile-ui is missing authorization to enable or disable users. Any user (logged in or not) with access to the page XWiki.XWikiUserProfileSheet can enable or disable any user profile. This might allow to a disabled user to re-enable themselves, or to an attacker to disable any user of the wiki. The problem has been patched in XWiki 13.10.7, 14.5RC1 and 14.4.2. Workarounds: The problem can be patched immediately by editing the page `XWiki.XWikiUserProfileSheet` in the wiki and by performing the changes contained in https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/5be1cc0adf917bf10899c47723fa451e950271fa.",
