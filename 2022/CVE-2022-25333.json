{"id": "CVE-2022-25333", "product": "OMAP", "version": "n/a", "vulnerability": ["Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature"], "description": "The Texas Instruments OMAP L138 (secure variants) trusted execution environment (TEE) performs an RSA check implemented in mask ROM when loading a module through the SK_LOAD routine. However, only the module header authenticity is validated. An adversary can re-use any correctly signed header and append a forged payload, to be encrypted using the CEK (obtainable through CVE-2022-25332) in order to obtain arbitrary code execution in secure context. This constitutes a full break of the TEE security architecture.", "poc": {"reference": ["https://tetraburst.com/"], "github": ["No PoCs found on GitHub currently."]}}
