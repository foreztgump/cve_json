{"id": "CVE-2022-0897", "product": "libvirt", "version": "n/a", "vulnerability": ["CWE-667"], "description": "A flaw was found in the libvirt nwfilter driver. The virNWFilterObjListNumOfNWFilters method failed to acquire the driver->nwfilters mutex before iterating over virNWFilterObj instances. There was no protection to stop another thread from concurrently modifying the driver->nwfilters object. This flaw allows a malicious, unprivileged user to exploit this issue via libvirt's API virConnectNumOfNWFilters to crash the network filter management daemon (libvirtd/virtnwfilterd).", "poc": {"reference": ["No PoCs from references."], "github": ["https://github.com/ARPSyndicate/cvemon"]}}
