For example, a victim may use the \"etags -u *\" command (suggested in the etags documentation) in a situation where the current working directory has contents that depend on untrusted input.", "poc": {"reference": ["No PoCs from references."], "github": ["https://github.com/ARPSyndicate/cvemon"]}}
