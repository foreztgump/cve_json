    "description": "Due to reliance on a trivial substitution cipher, sent in cleartext, and the reliance on a default password when the user does not set a password, the Remote Mouse Server by Emote Interactive can be abused by attackers to inject OS commands over theproduct's custom control protocol. A Metasploit module was written and tested against version 4.110, the current version when this CVE was reserved.",
