{"id": "CVE-2022-1552", "product": "postgresql", "version": "n/a", "vulnerability": ["CWE-459- Incomplete Cleanup, CWE-89 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')."], "description": "A flaw was found in PostgreSQL. There is an issue with incomplete efforts to operate safely when a privileged user is maintaining another user's objects. The Autovacuum, REINDEX, CREATE INDEX, REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW, CLUSTER, and pg_amcheck commands activated relevant protections too late or not at all during the process. This flaw allows an attacker with permission to create non-temporary objects in at least one schema to execute arbitrary SQL functions under a superuser identity.", "poc": {"reference": ["No PoCs from references."], "github": ["https://github.com/ARPSyndicate/cvemon"]}}
