Versions prior to 2.5.0 are subject to a Server-Side Request Forgery that leads to Cross-Site Scripting. A Server-Side request forgery in `IssueProxyResourceService::getMdImageByUrl` allows an attacker to access internal resources, as well as executing JavaScript code in the context of Metersphere's origin by a victim of a reflected XSS. This vulnerability has been fixed in v2.5.0. There are no known workarounds.", "poc": {"reference": ["https://github.com/metersphere/metersphere/security/advisories/GHSA-vrv6-cg45-rmjj"], "github": ["No PoCs found on GitHub currently."]}}
