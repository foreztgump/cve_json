    "description": "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the `tf.compat.v1.signal.rfft2d` and `tf.compat.v1.signal.rfft3d` lack input validation and under certain condition can result in crashes (due to `CHECK`-failures). Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.",
