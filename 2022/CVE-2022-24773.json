{"id": "CVE-2022-24773", "product": "forge", "version": "n/a", "vulnerability": ["CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature"], "description": "Forge (also called `node-forge`) is a native implementation of Transport Layer Security in JavaScript. Prior to version 1.3.0, RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signature verification code does not properly check `DigestInfo` for a proper ASN.1 structure. This can lead to successful verification with signatures that contain invalid structures but a valid digest. The issue has been addressed in `node-forge` version 1.3.0. There are currently no known workarounds.", "poc": {"reference": ["No PoCs from references."], "github": ["https://github.com/ARPSyndicate/cvemon", "https://github.com/MaySoMusician/geidai-ikoi", "https://github.com/karimhabush/cyberowl"]}}
