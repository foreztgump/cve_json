{"id": "CVE-2022-22115", "product": "docs", "version": ">= v1.5 ", "vulnerability": ["CWE-79 Cross-site Scripting (XSS)"], "description": "In Teedy, versions v1.5 through v1.9 are vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the name of a created Tag. Since the Tag name is not being sanitized properly in the edit tag page, a low privileged attacker can store malicious scripts in the name of the Tag. In the worst case, the victim who inadvertently triggers the attack is a highly privileged administrator. The injected scripts can extract the Session ID, which can lead to full Account Takeover of the administrator, and privileges escalation.", "poc": {"reference": ["https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/vulnerability-database/CVE-2022-22115"], "github": ["No PoCs found on GitHub currently."]}}
