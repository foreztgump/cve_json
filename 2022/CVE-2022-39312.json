{"id": "CVE-2022-39312", "product": "dataease", "version": "n/a", "vulnerability": ["CWE-20: Improper Input Validation", "CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data"], "description": "Dataease is an open source data visualization analysis tool. Dataease prior to 1.15.2 has a deserialization vulnerability. In Dataease, the Mysql data source in the data source function can customize the JDBC connection parameters and the Mysql server target to be connected. In `backend/src/main/java/io/dataease/provider/datasource/JdbcProvider.java`, the `MysqlConfiguration` class does not filter any parameters. If an attacker adds some parameters to a JDBC url and connects to a malicious mysql server, the attacker can trigger the mysql jdbc deserialization vulnerability. Through the deserialization vulnerability, the attacker can execute system commands and obtain server privileges. Version 1.15.2 contains a patch for this issue.", "poc": {"reference": ["No PoCs from references."], "github": ["https://github.com/ARPSyndicate/cvemon", "https://github.com/aboutbo/aboutbo"]}}
