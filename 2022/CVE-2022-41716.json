{"id": "CVE-2022-41716", "product": "os/exec", "version": "0< 1.18.8 ", "vulnerability": ["CWE-158: Improper Neutralization of Null Byte or NUL Character"], "description": "Due to unsanitized NUL values, attackers may be able to maliciously set environment variables on Windows. In syscall.StartProcess and os/exec.Cmd, invalid environment variable values containing NUL values are not properly checked for. A malicious environment variable value can exploit this behavior to set a value for a different environment variable. For example, the environment variable string \"A=B\\x00C=D\" sets the variables \"A=B\" and \"C=D\".", "poc": {"reference": ["No PoCs from references."], "github": ["https://github.com/ARPSyndicate/cvemon", "https://github.com/kb5fls/container-security", "https://github.com/ruzickap/malware-cryptominer-container"]}}
