    "product": "https://github.com/curl/curl",
    "version": "Fixed in 7.86.0 ",
    "vulnerability": [
        "Out-of-bounds Read (CWE-125)"
    ],
    "description": "curl can be told to parse a `.netrc` file for credentials. If that file endsin a line with 4095 consecutive non-white space letters and no newline, curlwould first read past the end of the stack-based buffer, and if the readworks, write a zero byte beyond its boundary.This will in most cases cause a segfault or similar, but circumstances might also cause different outcomes.If a malicious user can provide a custom netrc file to an application or otherwise affect its contents, this flaw could be used as denial-of-service.",
