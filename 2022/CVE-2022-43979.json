    "description": "There is a Path Traversal that leads to a Local File Inclusion in Pandora FMS v764. A function is called to check that the parameter that the user has inserted does not contain malicious characteres, but this check is insufficient. An attacker could insert an absolute path to overcome the heck, thus being able to incluse any PHP file that resides on the disk. The exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a remote code execution.",
