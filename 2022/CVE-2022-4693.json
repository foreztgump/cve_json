    "description": "The User Verification WordPress plugin before 1.0.94 was affected by an Auth Bypass security vulnerability. To bypass authentication, we only need to know the user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s username. Depending on whose username we know, which can be easily queried because it is usually public data, we may even be given an administrative role on the website.",
