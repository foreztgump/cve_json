    ],
    "description": "The AdRotate Banner Manager \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The only ad manager you'll need plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file extension sanitization in the adrotate_insert_media() function in all versions up to, and including, 5.13.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files with double extensions on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. This is only exploitable on select instances where the configuration will execute the first extension present.",
