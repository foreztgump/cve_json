This issue makes it possible for a misbehaving VMM to write to SYNIC/STIMER MSRs, causing a NULL pointer dereference. This flaw allows an unprivileged local attacker on the host to issue specific ioctl calls, causing a kernel oops condition that results in a denial of service.", "poc": {"reference": ["https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/06/22/1"], "github": ["https://github.com/ARPSyndicate/cvemon"]}}
