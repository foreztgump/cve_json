{"id": "CVE-2022-3437", "product": "samba", "version": "n/a", "vulnerability": ["CWE-122 - Heap-based Buffer Overflow, CWE-787 - Out-of-bounds Write"], "description": "A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability was found in Samba within the GSSAPI unwrap_des() and unwrap_des3() routines of Heimdal. The DES and Triple-DES decryption routines in the Heimdal GSSAPI library allow a length-limited write buffer overflow on malloc() allocated memory when presented with a maliciously small packet. This flaw allows a remote user to send specially crafted malicious data to the application, possibly resulting in a denial of service (DoS) attack.", "poc": {"reference": ["No PoCs from references."], "github": ["https://github.com/ARPSyndicate/cvemon", "https://github.com/fkie-cad/nvd-json-data-feeds"]}}
