In a misconfigured environment that exposes the Blue Prism Application server, it is possible for an authenticated user to reverse engineer the Blue Prism software and circumvent access controls for the setValidationInfo administrative function. Removing the validation applied to newly designed processes increases the chance of successfully hiding malicious code that could be executed in a production environment.", "poc": {"reference": ["https://community.blueprism.com/discussion/security-vulnerability-notification-ssc-blue-prism-enterprise"], "github": ["No PoCs found on GitHub currently."]}}
