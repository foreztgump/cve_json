Because of a race condition (unmap_mapping_range versus munmap), a device driver can free a page while it still has stale TLB entries. This only occurs in situations with VM_PFNMAP VMAs.", "poc": {"reference": ["https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v5.x/ChangeLog-5.19"], "github": ["https://github.com/ARPSyndicate/cvemon"]}}
