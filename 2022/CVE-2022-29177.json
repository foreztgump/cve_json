Prior to version 1.10.17, a vulnerable node, if configured to use high verbosity logging, can be made to crash when handling specially crafted p2p messages sent from an attacker node. Version 1.10.17 contains a patch that addresses the problem. As a workaround, setting loglevel to default level (`INFO`) makes the node not vulnerable to this attack.", "poc": {"reference": ["No PoCs from references."], "github": ["https://github.com/ARPSyndicate/cvemon", "https://github.com/VPRLab/BlkVulnReport", "https://github.com/demining/Solidity-Forcibly-Send-Ether-Vulnerability"]}}
