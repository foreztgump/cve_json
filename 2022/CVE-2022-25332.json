    "id": "CVE-2022-25332",
    "product": "OMAP",
    "version": "n/a",
    "vulnerability": [
        "Observable Timing Discrepancy"
    ],
    "description": "The AES implementation in the Texas Instruments OMAP L138 (secure variants), present in mask ROM, suffers from a timing side channel which can be exploited by an adversary with non-secure supervisor privileges by managing cache contents and collecting timing information for different ciphertext inputs. Using this side channel, the SK_LOAD secure kernel routine can be used to recover the Customer Encryption Key (CEK).",
