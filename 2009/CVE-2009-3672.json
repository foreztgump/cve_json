    "description": "Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 and 7 does not properly handle objects in memory that (1) were not properly initialized or (2) are deleted, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via vectors involving a call to the getElementsByTagName method for the STYLE tag name, selection of the single element in the returned list, and a change to the outerHTML property of this element, related to Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and mshtml.dll, aka \"HTML Object Memory Corruption Vulnerability.\" NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information. NOTE: this issue was originally assigned CVE-2009-4054, but Microsoft assigned a duplicate identifier of CVE-2009-3672. CVE consumers should use this identifier instead of CVE-2009-4054.",
