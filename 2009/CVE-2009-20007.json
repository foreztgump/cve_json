    "description": "Talkative IRC v0.4.4.16 is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow when processing specially crafted response strings sent to a connected client. An attacker can exploit this flaw by sending an overly long message that overflows a fixed-length buffer, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution in the context of the vulnerable process. This vulnerability is exploitable remotely and does not require authentication.",
