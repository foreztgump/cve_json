    "description": "The shm_get_stat function in ipc/shm.c in the shm subsystem in the Linux kernel before 2.6.28.5, when CONFIG_SHMEM is disabled, misinterprets the data type of an inode, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system hang) via an SHM_INFO shmctl call, as demonstrated by running the ipcs program.",
