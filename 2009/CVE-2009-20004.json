        "CWE-121 Stack-based Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "description": "gAlan 0.2.1, a modular audio processing environment for Windows, is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow when parsing .galan files. The application fails to properly validate the length of input data, allowing a specially crafted file to overwrite the stack and execute arbitrary code.
