    "description": "Belkin Bulldog Plus version 4.0.2 build 1219 contains a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in its web service authentication handler. When a specially crafted HTTP request is sent with an oversized Authorization header, the application fails to properly validate the input length before copying it into a fixed-size buffer, resulting in memory corruption and potential remote code execution. Exploitation requires network access and does not require prior authentication.",
