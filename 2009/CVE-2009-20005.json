        "CWE-121 Stack-based Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "description": "A stack-based buffer overflow exists in the UtilConfigHome.csp endpoint of InterSystems Cach\u221a\u00a9 2009.1. The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request containing an oversized argument to the .csp handler. Due to insufficient bounds checking, the input overflows a stack buffer, allowing an attacker to overwrite control structures and execute arbitrary code. It is unknown if this vulnerability was patched and an affected version range remains undefined.",
