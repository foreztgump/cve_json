    ],
    "description": "lib/crypto/c_src/crypto_drv.c in erlang does not properly check the return value from the OpenSSL DSA_do_verify function, which might allow remote attackers to bypass validation of the certificate chain via a malformed SSL/TLS signature, a similar vulnerability to CVE-2008-5077.  NOTE: a package maintainer disputes this issue, reporting that there is a proper check within the only code that uses the applicable part of crypto_drv.c, and thus \"this report is invalid.",
