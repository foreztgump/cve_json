    "description": "Cytel Studio version 9.0 and earlier is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow triggered by parsing a malformed .CY3 file. The vulnerability occurs when the application copies user-controlled strings into a fixed-size stack buffer (256 bytes) without proper bounds checking. Exploitation allows arbitrary code execution when the crafted file is opened.",
