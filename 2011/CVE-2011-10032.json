        "CWE-121 Stack-based Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "description": "Sunway ForceControl version 6.1 SP3 and earlier contains a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the SNMP NetDBServer service, which listens on TCP port 2001. The flaw is triggered when the service receives a specially crafted packet using opcode 0x57 with an overly long payload. Due to improper bounds checking during packet parsing, attacker-controlled data overwrites the Structured Exception Handler (SEH), allowing arbitrary code execution in the context of the service. This vulnerability can be exploited remotely without authentication and may lead to full system compromise on affected Windows hosts.",
