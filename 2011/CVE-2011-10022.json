        "CWE-120 Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')"
    ],
    "description": "SPlayer version 3.7 and earlier is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow when processing HTTP responses containing an overly long Content-Type header. The vulnerability occurs due to improper bounds checking on the header value, allowing an attacker to overwrite the Structured Exception Handler (SEH) and execute arbitrary code. Exploitation requires the victim to open a media file that triggers an HTTP request to a malicious server, which responds with a crafted Content-Type header.",
