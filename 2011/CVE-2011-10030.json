    "description": "Foxit PDF Reader <\u00c2\u00a0 4.3.1.0218 exposes a JavaScript API function, createDataObject(), that allows untrusted PDF content to write arbitrary files anywhere on disk. By embedding a malicious PDF that calls this API, an attacker can drop executables or scripts into privileged folders, leading to code execution the next time the system boots or the user logs in.",
