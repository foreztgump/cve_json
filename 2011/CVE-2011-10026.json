    "description": "Spreecommerce versions prior to 0.50.x contain a remote command execution vulnerability in the API's search functionality. Improper input sanitation allows attackers to inject arbitrary shell commands via the search[instance_eval] parameter, which is dynamically invoked using Ruby\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s send method. This flaw enables unauthenticated attackers to execute commands on the server.",
