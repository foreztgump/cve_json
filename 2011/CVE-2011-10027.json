        "CWE-121 Stack-based Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "description": "AOL Desktop 9.6 contains a buffer overflow vulnerability in its Tool\\rich.rct component when parsing .rtx files. By embedding an overly long string in a hyperlink tag, an attacker can trigger a stack-based buffer overflow due to the use of unsafe strcpy operations. This allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code when a victim opens a malicious .rtx file.\u00a0AOL Desktop is end-of-life and no longer supported.\u00a0Users are encouraged to migrate to AOL Desktop Gold or alternative platforms.",
