        "CWE-121 Stack-based Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "description": "GTA San Andreas Multiplayer (SA-MP) server version 0.3.1.1 is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow triggered by parsing a malformed server.cfg configuration file. The vulnerability allows local attackers to execute arbitrary code when the server binary (samp-server.exe) processes a crafted echo directive containing excessive input. The original 'sa-mp.com' site is defunct, but the community maintains mirrors and forks that may be vulnerable.",
