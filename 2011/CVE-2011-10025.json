        "CWE-120 Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')"
    ],
    "description": "Subtitle Processor 7.7.1 contains a buffer overflow vulnerability in its .m3u file parser. When a crafted playlist file is opened, the application converts input to Unicode and copies it to a fixed-size stack buffer without proper bounds checking. This allows an attacker to overwrite the Structured Exception Handler (SEH) and execute arbitrary code.",
