        "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function"
    ],
    "description": "Unitree Go2 firmware versions V1.1.7 through V1.1.9 and V1.1.11 (EDU) do not implement DDS authentication or authorization for the Eclipse CycloneDDS topic rt/api/programming_actuator/request handled by actuator_manager.py. A network-adjacent, unauthenticated attacker can join DDS domain 0 and publish a crafted message (api_id=1002) containing arbitrary Python, which the robot writes to disk under /unitree/etc/programming/ and binds to a physical controller keybinding. When the keybinding is pressed, the code executes as root and the binding persists across reboots.",
