    "description": "Craft Commerce is an ecommerce platform for Craft CMS. In versions from 4.0.0-RC1 to 4.10.0 and from 5.0.0 to 5.5.1, a stored XSS vulnerability exists in Craft Commerce\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Order Status History Message. The message is rendered using the |md filter, which permits raw HTML, enabling malicious script execution. If a user has database backup utility permissions (which do not require an elevated session), an attacker can exfiltrate the entire database, including all user credentials, customer PII, order history, and 2FA recovery codes. This issue has been patched in versions 4.10.1 and 5.5.2.",
