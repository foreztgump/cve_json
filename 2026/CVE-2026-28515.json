        "CWE-862 Missing Authorization"
    ],
    "description": "openDCIM version 23.04, through commit 4467e9c4, contains a missing authorization vulnerability in install.php and container-install.php. The installer and upgrade handler expose LDAP configuration functionality without enforcing application role checks. Any authenticated user can access this functionality regardless of assigned privileges. In deployments where REMOTE_USER is set without authentication enforcement, the endpoint may be accessible without credentials. This allows unauthorized modification of application configuration.",
