    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read"
    ],
    "description": "FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol. Prior to version 3.23.0, `xf_rail_server_execute_result` indexes the global `error_code_names[]` array (7 elements, indices 0\u00e2\u20ac\u201c6) with an unchecked `execResult->execResult` value received from the server, allowing an out-of-bounds read when the server sends an `execResult` value of 7 or greater. Version 3.23.0 fixes the issue.",
