    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-416: Use After Free"
    ],
    "description": "FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol. Prior to version 3.23.0, `xf_rail_server_local_move_size` dereferences a freed `xfAppWindow` pointer because `xf_rail_get_window` returns an unprotected pointer from the `railWindows` hash table, and the main thread can concurrently delete the window (via a window delete order) while the RAIL channel thread is still using the pointer. Version 3.23.0 fixes the issue.",
