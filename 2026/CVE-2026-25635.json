    "description": "calibre is an e-book manager. Prior to 9.2.0, Calibre's CHM reader contains a path traversal vulnerability that allows arbitrary file writes anywhere the user has write permissions. On Windows (haven't tested on other OS's), this can lead to Remote Code Execution by writing a payload to the Startup folder, which executes on next login. This vulnerability is fixed in 9.2.0.",
