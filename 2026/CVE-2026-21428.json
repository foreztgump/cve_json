    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')"
    ],
    "description": "cpp-httplib is a C++11 single-file header-only cross platform HTTP/HTTPS library. Prior to version 0.30.0, the ``write_headers`` function does not check for CR & LF characters in user supplied headers, allowing untrusted header value to escape header lines.This vulnerability allows attackers to add extra headers, modify request body unexpectedly & trigger an SSRF attack. When combined with a server that supports http1.1 pipelining (springboot, python twisted etc), this can be used for server side request forgery (SSRF). Version 0.30.0 fixes this issue.",
