    "description": "Intego Log Reporter, a macOS diagnostic utility bundled with Intego security products that collects system and application logs for support analysis, contains a local privilege escalation vulnerability. A root-executed diagnostic script creates and writes files in /tmp without enforcing secure directory handling, introducing a time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition. A local unprivileged user can exploit a symlink-based race condition to cause arbitrary file writes to privileged system locations, resulting in privilege escalation to root.",
