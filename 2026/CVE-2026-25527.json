    "product": "changedetection.io",
    "version": "< 0.53.2 ",
    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
    ],
    "description": "changedetection.io is a free open source web page change detection tool. In versions prior to 0.53.2, the `/static/<group>/<filename>` route accepts `group=\"..\"`, which causes `send_from_directory(\"static/..\", filename)` to execute. This moves the base directory up to `/app/changedetectionio`, enabling unauthenticated local file read of application source files (e.g., `flask_app.py`). Version 0.53.2 fixes the issue.",
