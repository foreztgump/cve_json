        "Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')"
    ],
    "description": "MajorDoMo (aka Major Domestic Module) allows unauthenticated remote code execution via the admin panel's PHP console feature. An include order bug in modules/panel.class.php causes execution to continue past a redirect() call that lacks an exit statement, allowing unauthenticated requests to reach the ajax handler in inc_panel_ajax.php. The console handler within that file passes user-supplied input from GET parameters (via register_globals) directly to eval() without any authentication check. An attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code by sending a crafted GET request to /admin.php with ajax_panel, op, and command parameters.",
