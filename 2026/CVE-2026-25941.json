    "description": "FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol. Versions on the 2.x branch prior to to 2.11.8 and on the 3.x branch prior to 3.23.0 have an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in the FreeRDP client's RDPGFX channel that allows a malicious RDP server to read uninitialized heap memory by sending a crafted WIRE_TO_SURFACE_2 PDU with a `bitmapDataLength` value larger than the actual data in the packet. This can lead to information disclosure or client crashes when a user connects to a malicious server. Versions 2.11.8 and 3.23.0 fix the issue.",
