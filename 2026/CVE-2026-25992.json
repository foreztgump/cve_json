    "description": "SiYuan is a personal knowledge management system. Prior to 3.5.5, the /api/file/getFile endpoint uses case-sensitive string equality checks to block access to sensitive files. On case-insensitive file systems such as Windows, attackers can bypass restrictions using mixed-case paths and read protected configuration files. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.5.5.",
