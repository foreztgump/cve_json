    "description": "LightLLM version 1.1.0 and prior contain an unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability in PD (prefill-decode) disaggregation mode. The PD master node exposes WebSocket endpoints that receive binary frames and pass the data directly to pickle.loads() without authentication or validation. A remote attacker who can reach the PD master can send a crafted payload to achieve arbitrary code execution.",
