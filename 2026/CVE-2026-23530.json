        "CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "description": "FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol. Prior to version 3.21.0,`freerdp_bitmap_decompress_planar` does not validate `nSrcWidth`/`nSrcHeight` against `planar->maxWidth`/`maxHeight` before RLE decode. A malicious server can trigger a client\u2011side heap buffer overflow, causing a crash (DoS) and potential heap corruption with code\u2011execution risk depending on allocator behavior and surrounding heap layout. Version 3.21.0 contains a patch for the issue.",
