        "CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
    ],
    "description": "AnythingLLM is an application that turns pieces of content into context that any LLM can use as references during chatting. Prior to version 1.10.0, a critical Path Traversal vulnerability in the DrupalWiki integration allows a malicious admin (or an attacker who can convince an admin to configure a malicious DrupalWiki URL) to write arbitrary files to the server. This can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) by overwriting configuration files or writing executable scripts. Version 1.10.0 fixes the issue.",
