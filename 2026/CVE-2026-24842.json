        "CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')",
        "CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')"
    ],
    "description": "node-tar,a Tar for Node.js, contains a vulnerability in versions prior to 7.5.7 where the security check for hardlink entries uses different path resolution semantics than the actual hardlink creation logic. This mismatch allows an attacker to craft a malicious TAR archive that bypasses path traversal protections and creates hardlinks to arbitrary files outside the extraction directory. Version 7.5.7 contains a fix for the issue.",
