        "CWE-121 Stack-based Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "description": "TinyOS versions up to and including 2.1.2 contain a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the mcp2200gpio utility. The vulnerability is caused by unsafe use of strcpy() and strcat() functions when constructing device paths during automatic device discovery. A local attacker can exploit this by creating specially crafted filenames under /dev/usb/, leading to stack memory corruption and application crashes.",
