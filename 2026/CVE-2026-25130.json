    "description": "Cybersecurity AI (CAI) is a framework for AI Security. In versions up to and including 0.5.10, the CAI (Cybersecurity AI) framework contains multiple argument injection vulnerabilities in its function tools. User-controlled input is passed directly to shell commands via `subprocess.Popen()` with `shell=True`, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the host system. The `find_file()` tool executes without requiring user approval because find is considered a \"safe\" pre-approved command. This means an attacker can achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) by injecting malicious arguments (like -exec) into the args parameter, completely bypassing any human-in-the-loop safety mechanisms. Commit e22a1220f764e2d7cf9da6d6144926f53ca01cde contains a fix.",
