        "CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')"
    ],
    "description": "WeKnora is an LLM-powered framework designed for deep document understanding and semantic retrieval. Prior to version 0.2.5, after WeKnora enables the Agent service, it allows users to call the database query tool. Due to insufficient backend validation, an attacker can use prompt\u00e2\u20ac\u2018based bypass techniques to evade query restrictions and obtain sensitive information from the target server and database. This issue has been patched in version 0.2.5.",
