    ],
    "description": "newbee-mall stores and verifies user passwords using an unsalted MD5 hashing algorithm. The implementation does not incorporate per-user salts or computational cost controls, enabling attackers who obtain password hashes through database exposure, backup leakage, or other compromise vectors to rapidly recover plaintext credentials via offline attacks.",
