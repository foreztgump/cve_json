        "CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "description": "GPAC is an open-source multimedia framework. In versions up to and including 26.02.0, a stack buffer overflow occurs during NHML file parsing in `src/filters/dmx_nhml.c`. The value of the xmlHeaderEnd XML attribute is copied from att->value into szXmlHeaderEnd[1000] using strcpy() without any length validation. If the input exceeds 1000 bytes, it overwrites beyond the stack buffer boundary. Commit 9bd7137fded2db40de61a2cf3045812c8741ec52 patches the issue.",
