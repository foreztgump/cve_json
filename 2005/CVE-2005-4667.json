    "description": "Buffer overflow in UnZip 5.50 and earlier allows user-assisted attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long filename command line argument.  NOTE: since the overflow occurs in a non-setuid program, there are not many scenarios under which it poses a vulnerability, unless unzip is passed long arguments when it is invoked from other programs.",
