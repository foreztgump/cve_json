    "description": "The audit system in Linux kernel 2.6.6, and other versions before 2.6.13.4, when CONFIG_AUDITSYSCALL is enabled, uses an incorrect function to free names_cache memory, which prevents the memory from being tracked by AUDITSYSCALL code and leads to a memory leak that allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).",
