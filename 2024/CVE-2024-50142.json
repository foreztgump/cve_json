    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:xfrm: validate new SA's prefixlen using SA family when sel.family is unsetThis expands the validation introduced in commit 07bf7908950a (\"xfrm:Validate address prefix lengths in the xfrm selector.\")syzbot created an SA with    usersa.sel.family = AF_UNSPEC    usersa.sel.prefixlen_s = 128    usersa.family = AF_INETBecause of the AF_UNSPEC selector, verify_newsa_info doesn't putlimits on prefixlen_{s,d}. But then copy_from_user_state setsx->sel.family to usersa.family (AF_INET). Do the same conversion inverify_newsa_info before validating prefixlen_{s,d}, since that's howprefixlen is going to be used later on.",
