    "description": "SOPlanning 1.53.00 is vulnerable to a directory traversal issue in /process/upload.php. The \"fichier_to_delete\" parameter allows authenticated attackers to specify file paths containing directory traversal sequences (e.g., ../). This vulnerability enables attackers to delete arbitrary files outside the intended upload directory, potentially leading to denial of service or disruption of application functionality.",
