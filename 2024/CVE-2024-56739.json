    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:rtc: check if __rtc_read_time was successful in rtc_timer_do_work()If the __rtc_read_time call fails,, the struct rtc_time tm; may containuninitialized data, or an illegal date/time read from the RTC hardware.When calling rtc_tm_to_ktime later, the result may be a very large value(possibly KTIME_MAX). If there are periodic timers in rtc->timerqueue,they will continually expire, may causing kernel softlockup.",
