    "product": "dom-iterator",
    "version": "0< * ",
    "vulnerability": [
        "Arbitrary Code Execution"
    ],
    "description": "Versions of the package dom-iterator before 1.0.1 are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution due to use of the Function constructor without complete input sanitization. Function generates a new function body and thus care must be given to ensure that the inputs to Function are not attacker-controlled. The risks involved are similar to that of allowing attacker-controlled input to reach eval.",
