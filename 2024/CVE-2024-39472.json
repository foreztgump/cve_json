    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:xfs: fix log recovery buffer allocation for the legacy h_size fixupCommit a70f9fe52daa (\"xfs: detect and handle invalid iclog size set bymkfs\") added a fixup for incorrect h_size values used for the initialumount record in old xfsprogs versions.  Later commit 0c771b99d6c9(\"xfs: clean up calculation of LR header blocks\") cleaned up the logreover buffer calculation, but stoped using the fixed up h_size valueto size the log recovery buffer, which can lead to an out of boundsaccess when the incorrect h_size does not come from the old mkfstool, but a fuzzer.Fix this by open coding xlog_logrec_hblks and taking the fixed h_sizeinto account for this calculation.",
