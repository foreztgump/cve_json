    "description": "changedetection.io is free, open source web page change detection software. Prior to version 0.47.5, when a WebDriver is used to fetch files, `source:file:///etc/passwd` can be used to retrieve local system files, where the more traditional `file:///etc/passwd` gets blocked. Version 0.47.5 fixes the issue.",
