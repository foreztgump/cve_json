Prior to commit c4f81d9616d40c60584e36abb15300853a66e489, the `vis_params` variable on line 115 in `pages/10_\uf8ff\u00fc\u00e5\u00e7_Earth_Engine_Datasets.py` takes user input, which is later used in the `eval()` function on line 126, leading to remote code execution. Commit c4f81d9616d40c60584e36abb15300853a66e489 fixes this issue.",
