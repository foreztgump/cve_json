    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:wifi: rtlwifi: remove unused check_buddy_privCommit 2461c7d60f9f (\"rtlwifi: Update header file\") introduced a globallist of private data structures.Later on, commit 26634c4b1868 (\"rtlwifi Modify existing bits to matchvendor version 2013.02.07\") started adding the private data to that list atprobe time and added a hook, check_buddy_priv to find the private data froma similar device.However, that function was never used.Besides, though there is a lock for that list, it is never used. And whenthe probe fails, the private data is never removed from the list. Thiswould cause a second probe to access freed memory.Remove the unused hook, structures and members, which will prevent thepotential race condition on the list and its corruption during a secondprobe when probe fails.",
