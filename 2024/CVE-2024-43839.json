    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:bna: adjust 'name' buf size of bna_tcb and bna_ccb structuresTo have enough space to write all possible sprintf() args. Currently'name' size is 16, but the first '%s' specifier may already need atleast 16 characters, since 'bnad->netdev->name' is used there.For '%d' specifiers, assume that they require: * 1 char for 'tx_id + tx_info->tcb[i]->id' sum, BNAD_MAX_TXQ_PER_TX is 8 * 2 chars for 'rx_id + rx_info->rx_ctrl[i].ccb->id', BNAD_MAX_RXP_PER_RX   is 16And replace sprintf with snprintf.Detected using the static analysis tool - Svace.",
