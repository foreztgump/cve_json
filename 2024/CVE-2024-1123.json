        "CWE-862 Missing Authorization"
    ],
    "description": "The EventPrime \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Events Calendar, Bookings and Tickets plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the save_frontend_event_submission() function in all versions up to, and including, 3.4.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to overwrite the title and content of arbitrary posts. This can also be exploited by unauthenticated attackers when the allow_submission_by_anonymous_user setting is enabled.",
