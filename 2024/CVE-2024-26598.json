    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:KVM: arm64: vgic-its: Avoid potential UAF in LPI translation cacheThere is a potential UAF scenario in the case of an LPI translationcache hit racing with an operation that invalidates the cache, suchas a DISCARD ITS command. The root of the problem is thatvgic_its_check_cache() does not elevate the refcount on the vgic_irqbefore dropping the lock that serializes refcount changes.Have vgic_its_check_cache() raise the refcount on the returned vgic_irqand add the corresponding decrement after queueing the interrupt.",
