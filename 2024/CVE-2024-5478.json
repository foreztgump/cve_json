        "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
    ],
    "description": "A Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the SAML metadata endpoint `/auth/saml/${org?.id}/metadata` of lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.7. The vulnerability arises due to the application's failure to escape or validate the `orgId` parameter supplied by the user before incorporating it into the generated response. Specifically, the endpoint generates XML responses for SAML metadata, where the `orgId` parameter is directly embedded into the XML structure without proper sanitization or validation. This flaw allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the generated SAML metadata page, leading to potential theft of user cookies or authentication tokens.",
