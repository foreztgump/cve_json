    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read"
    ],
    "description": "Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. An out-of-bounds read was found in Exiv2 version v0.28.1. The vulnerable function, `QuickTimeVideo::NikonTagsDecoder`, was new in v0.28.0, so Exiv2 versions before v0.28 are _not_ affected. The out-of-bounds read is triggered when Exiv2 is used to read the metadata of a crafted video file. In most cases this out of bounds read will result in a crash. This bug is fixed in version v0.28.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
