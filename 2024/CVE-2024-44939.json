This will cause thepreviously true judgment \"p->header.flag & BT-LEAF\" to change to no after writingthe name operation, this leads to entering an incorrect branch and accessing theuninitialized object ih when judging this condition for the second time.[Fix]After got the page, check freelist first, if freelist == 0 then exit dtInsert()and return -EINVAL.",
