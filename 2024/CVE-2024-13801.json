    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-862 Missing Authorization"
    ],
    "description": "The BWL Advanced FAQ Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data that can lead to a denial of service due to a missing capability check on the 'baf_set_notice_status' AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to update option values to '1' on the WordPress site. This can be leveraged to update an option that would create an error on the site and deny service to legitimate users or be used to set some values to true such as registration.",
