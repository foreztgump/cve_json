    "description": "The The Active Products Tables for WooCommerce. Use constructor to create tables plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution via woot_get_smth AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.6.5. This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes.",
