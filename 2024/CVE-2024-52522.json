        "CWE-281: Improper Preservation of Permissions",
        "CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')",
        "CWE-61: UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following"
    ],
    "description": "Rclone is a command-line program to sync files and directories to and from different cloud storage providers. Insecure handling of symlinks with --links and --metadata in rclone while copying to local disk allows unprivileged users to indirectly modify ownership and permissions on symlink target files when a superuser or privileged process performs a copy. This vulnerability could enable privilege escalation and unauthorized access to critical system files, compromising system integrity, confidentiality, and availability. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.68.2.",
