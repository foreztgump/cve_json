        "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
    ],
    "description": "The FooGallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via image attachment fields (such as 'Title', 'Alt Text', 'Custom URL', 'Custom Class', and 'Override Type') in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.14 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
