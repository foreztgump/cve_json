    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:cachefiles: add consistency check for copen/creadThis prevents malicious processes from completing random copen/creadrequests and crashing the system. Added checks are listed below:  * Generic, copen can only complete open requests, and cread can only    complete read requests.  * For copen, ondemand_id must not be 0, because this indicates that the    request has not been read by the daemon.  * For cread, the object corresponding to fd and req should be the same.",
