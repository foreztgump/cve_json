        "CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor"
    ],
    "description": "In SAP Commerce, valid user accounts can beidentified during the customer registration and login processes. This allows apotential attacker to learn if a given e-mail is used for an account, but doesnot grant access to any customer data beyond this knowledge. The attacker mustalready know the e-mail that they wish to test for. The impact onconfidentiality therefore is low and no impact to integrity or availability",
