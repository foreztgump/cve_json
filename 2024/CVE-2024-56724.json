    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mfd: intel_soc_pmic_bxtwc: Use IRQ domain for TMU deviceWhile design wise the idea of converting the driver to usethe hierarchy of the IRQ chips is correct, the implementationhas (inherited) flaws. This was unveiled when platform_get_irq()had started WARN() on IRQ 0 that is supposed to be a LinuxIRQ number (also known as vIRQ).Rework the driver to respect IRQ domain when creating each MFDdevice separately, as the domain is not the same for all of them.",
