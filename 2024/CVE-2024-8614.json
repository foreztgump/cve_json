    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type"

    "description": "The JobSearch WP Job Board plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the jobsearch_wp_handle_upload() function in all versions up to, and including, 2.6.7.
