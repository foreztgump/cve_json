    "description": "A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in berriai/litellm version 1.38.10. This vulnerability allows users to specify the `api_base` parameter when making requests to `POST /chat/completions`, causing the application to send the request to the domain specified by `api_base`. This request includes the OpenAI API key. A malicious user can set the `api_base` to their own domain and intercept the OpenAI API key, leading to unauthorized access and potential misuse of the API key.",
