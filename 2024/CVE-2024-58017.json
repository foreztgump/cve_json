    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:printk: Fix signed integer overflow when defining LOG_BUF_LEN_MAXShifting 1 << 31 on a 32-bit int causes signed integer overflow, whichleads to undefined behavior. To prevent this, cast 1 to u32 beforeperforming the shift, ensuring well-defined behavior.This change explicitly avoids any potential overflow by ensuring thatthe shift occurs on an unsigned 32-bit integer.",
