    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type"
    ],
    "description": "The FileOrganizer \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Manage WordPress and Website Files plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the \"fileorganizer_ajax_handler\" function in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.9. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, and permissions granted by an administrator, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. NOTE: The FileOrganizer Pro plugin must be installed and active to allow Subscriber+ users to upload files.",
