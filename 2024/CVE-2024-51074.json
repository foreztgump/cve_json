    "description": "** DISPUTED ** Incorrect access control in KIA Seltos vehicle instrument cluster with software and hardware v1.0 allows attackers to arbitrarily change odometer readings in the vehicle by targeting the instrument cluster through the unsecured CAN network. NOTE: this is disputed by the supplier because the CAN bus is not externally exposed, and because the packets can only increase the odometer reading (which has no value to an adversary).",
