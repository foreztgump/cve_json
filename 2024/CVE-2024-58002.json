    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:media: uvcvideo: Remove dangling pointersWhen an async control is written, we copy a pointer to the file handlethat started the operation. That pointer will be used when the device isdone. Which could be anytime in the future.If the user closes that file descriptor, its structure will be freed,and there will be one dangling pointer per pending async control, thatthe driver will try to use.Clean all the dangling pointers during release().To avoid adding a performance penalty in the most common case (no asyncoperation), a counter has been introduced with some logic to make surethat it is properly handled.",
