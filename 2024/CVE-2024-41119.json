Prior to commit c4f81d9616d40c60584e36abb15300853a66e489, the `vis_params` variable on line 80 in `8_\uf8ff\u00fc\u00e8\u00fa\u00d4\u220f\u00e8_Raster_Data_Visualization.py` takes user input, which is later used in the `eval()` function on line 86, leading to remote code execution. Commit c4f81d9616d40c60584e36abb15300853a66e489 fixes this issue.",
