    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ext4: fix infinite loop when replaying fast_commitWhen doing fast_commit replay an infinite loop may occur due to anuninitialized extent_status struct.  ext4_ext_determine_insert_hole() doesnot detect the replay and calls ext4_es_find_extent_range(), which willreturn immediately without initializing the 'es' variable.Because 'es' contains garbage, an integer overflow may happen causing aninfinite loop in this function, easily reproducible using fstest generic/039.This commit fixes this issue by unconditionally initializing the structurein function ext4_es_find_extent_range().Thanks to Zhang Yi, for figuring out the real problem!",
