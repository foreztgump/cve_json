    "id": "CVE-2024-47943",
    "product": "IoT Interface & CMC III Processing Unit",
    "version": "<6.21.00.2 ",
    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature"
    ],
    "description": "The firmware upgrade function in the admin web interface of the Rittal\u00c2\u00a0IoT Interface & CMC III Processing Unit devices checks if the patch files are signed before executing the containing run.sh script. The signing process is kind of an HMAC with a long string as key which is hard-coded in the firmware and is freely available for download. This allows crafting malicious \"signed\" .patch files in order to compromise the device and execute arbitrary code.",
