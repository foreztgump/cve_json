Port\"log severity\") ignores -EINVAL error message on common soc_pcm_ret().It is used from many functions, ignoring -EINVAL is over-kill.The reason why -EINVAL was ignored was it really should only be usedupon invalid parameters coming from userspace and in that case we don'twant to log an error since we do not want to give userspace a way to doa denial-of-service attack on the syslog / diskspace.So don't use soc_pcm_ret() on .prepare callback is better idea.",
