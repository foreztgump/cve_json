    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:rtc: pcf85063: fix potential OOB write in PCF85063 NVMEM readThe nvmem interface supports variable buffer sizes, while the regmapinterface operates with fixed-size storage. If an nvmem client uses abuffer size less than 4 bytes, regmap_read will write out of boundsas it expects the buffer to point at an unsigned int.Fix this by using an intermediary unsigned int to hold the value.",
