    "description": "A vulnerability in Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on the control plane of an affected device.  This vulnerability is due to improper handling of frames with VLAN tag information. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted frames to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to render the control plane of the affected device unresponsive. The device would not be accessible through the console or CLI, and it would not respond to ping requests, SNMP requests, or requests from other control plane protocols. Traffic that is traversing the device through the data plane is not affected. A reload of the device is required to restore control plane services.",
