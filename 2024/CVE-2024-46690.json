    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:nfsd: fix nfsd4_deleg_getattr_conflict in presence of third party leaseIt is not safe to dereference fl->c.flc_owner without first confirmingfl->fl_lmops is the expected manager.  nfsd4_deleg_getattr_conflict()tests fl_lmops but largely ignores the result and assumes that flc_owneris an nfs4_delegation anyway.  This is wrong.With this patch we restore the \"!= &nfsd_lease_mng_ops\" case to behaveas it did before the change mentioned below.  This is the same as thecurrent code, but without any reference to a possible delegation.",
