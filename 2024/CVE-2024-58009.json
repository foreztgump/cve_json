    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:Bluetooth: L2CAP: handle NULL sock pointer in l2cap_sock_allocA NULL sock pointer is passed into l2cap_sock_alloc() when it is calledfrom l2cap_sock_new_connection_cb() and the error handling paths shouldalso be aware of it.Seemingly a more elegant solution would be to swap bt_sock_alloc() andl2cap_chan_create() calls since they are not interdependent to that momentbut then l2cap_chan_create() adds the soon to be deallocated and stilldummy-initialized channel to the global list accessible by many L2CAPpaths. The channel would be removed from the list in short period of timebut be a bit more straight-forward here and just check for NULL instead ofchanging the order of function calls.Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE staticanalysis tool.",
