    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:dm-crypt: don't modify the data when using authenticated encryptionIt was said that authenticated encryption could produce invalid tag whenthe data that is being encrypted is modified [1]. So, fix this problem bycopying the data into the clone bio first and then encrypt them inside theclone bio.This may reduce performance, but it is needed to prevent the user fromcorrupting the device by writing data with O_DIRECT and modifying them atthe same time.[1] https://lore.kernel.org/all/20240207004723.GA35324@sol.localdomain/T/",
