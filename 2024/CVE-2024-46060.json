    "description": "Anaconda3 macOS installers before 2024.06-1 contain a local privilege escalation vulnerability when installed outside the user's home directory. During installation, world-writable files are created and executed with root privileges. This allows a local low-privileged user to inject arbitrary commands, leading to code execution as the root user.",
