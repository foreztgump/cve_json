    "product": "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 10",
    "version": "46.alpha ",
    "vulnerability": [
        "Exposure of Data Element to Wrong Session"
    ],
    "description": "A flaw was found in the gnome-remote-desktop package. The gnome-remote-desktop system daemon performs inadequate validation of session agents using D-Bus methods related to transitioning a client connection from the login screen to the user session. As a result, the system RDP TLS certificate and key can be exposed to unauthorized users. This flaw allows a malicious user on the system to take control of the RDP client connection during the login screen-to-user session transition.",
