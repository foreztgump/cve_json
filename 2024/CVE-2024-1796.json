    ],
    "description": "The HUSKY \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Products Filter for WooCommerce Professional plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'woof' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.5.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes such as 'swoof_slug'. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
