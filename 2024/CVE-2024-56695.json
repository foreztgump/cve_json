    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/amdkfd: Use dynamic allocation for CU occupancy array in 'kfd_get_cu_occupancy()'The `kfd_get_cu_occupancy` function previously declared a large`cu_occupancy` array as a local variable, which could lead to stackoverflows due to excessive stack usage. This commit replaces the staticarray allocation with dynamic memory allocation using `kcalloc`,thereby reducing the stack size.This change avoids the risk of stack overflows in kernel space,  inscenarios where `AMDGPU_MAX_QUEUES` is large. The  allocated memory isfreed using `kfree` before the function returns  to prevent memoryleaks.Fixes the below with gcc W=1:drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../amdkfd/kfd_process.c: In function \u2018kfd_get_cu_occupancy\u2019:drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../amdkfd/kfd_process.c:322:1: warning: the frame size of 1056 bytes is larger than 1024 bytes [-Wframe-larger-than=]  322 | }      | ^",
