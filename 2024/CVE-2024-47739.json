    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:padata: use integer wrap around to prevent deadlock on seq_nr overflowWhen submitting more than 2^32 padata objects to padata_do_serial, thecurrent sorting implementation incorrectly sorts padata objects withoverflowed seq_nr, causing them to be placed before existing objects inthe reorder list. This leads to a deadlock in the serialization processas padata_find_next cannot match padata->seq_nr and pd->processedbecause the padata instance with overflowed seq_nr will be selectednext.To fix this, we use an unsigned integer wrap around to correctly sortpadata objects in scenarios with integer overflow.",
