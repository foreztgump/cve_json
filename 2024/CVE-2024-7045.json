        "CWE-862 Missing Authorization"
    ],
    "description": "In version v0.3.8 of open-webui/open-webui, improper access control vulnerabilities allow an attacker to view any prompts. The application does not verify whether the attacker is an administrator, allowing the attacker to directly call the /api/v1/prompts/ interface to retrieve all prompt information created by the admin, which includes the ID values. Subsequently, the attacker can exploit the /api/v1/prompts/command/{command_id} interface to obtain arbitrary prompt information.",
