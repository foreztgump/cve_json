        "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
    ],
    "description": "The WP Abstracts plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.7.2. This is due to missing nonce validation on the wpabstracts_load_status() and wpabstracts_delete_abstracts() functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
