        "CWE-120 Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')"
    ],
    "description": "A stack-buffer overflow vulnerability exists in all versions of sngrep since v1.4.1. The flaw is due to inadequate bounds checking when copying 'Content-Length' and 'Warning' headers into fixed-size buffers in the sip_validate_packet and sip_parse_extra_headers functions within src/sip.c. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (DoS) via crafted SIP\u00c2\u00a0messages.",
