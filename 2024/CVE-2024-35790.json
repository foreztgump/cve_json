    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:usb: typec: altmodes/displayport: create sysfs nodes as driver's default device attribute groupThe DisplayPort driver's sysfs nodes may be present to the userspace beforetypec_altmode_set_drvdata() completes in dp_altmode_probe. This means thata sysfs read can trigger a NULL pointer error by deferencing dp->hpd inhpd_show or dp->lock in pin_assignment_show, as dev_get_drvdata() returnsNULL in those cases.Remove manual sysfs node creation in favor of adding attribute group asdefault for devices bound to the driver. The ATTRIBUTE_GROUPS() macro isnot used here otherwise the path to the sysfs nodes is no longer compliantwith the ABI.",
