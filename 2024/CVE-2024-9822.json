    ],
    "description": "The Pedalo Connector plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions up to, and including, 2.0.5. This is due to insufficient restriction on the 'login_admin_user' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log to the first user, who is usually the administrator, or if it does not exist, then to the first administrator.",
