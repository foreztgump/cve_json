    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: stmmac: Fix zero-division error when disabling tc cbsThe commit b8c43360f6e4 (\"net: stmmac: No need to calculate speed dividerwhen offload is disabled\") allows the \"port_transmit_rate_kbps\" to beset to a value of 0, which is then passed to the \"div_s64\" function whentc-cbs is disabled. This leads to a zero-division error.When tc-cbs is disabled, the idleslope, sendslope, and credit values thecredit values are not required to be configured. Therefore, adding a returnstatement after setting the txQ mode to DCB when tc-cbs is disabled wouldprevent a zero-division error.",
