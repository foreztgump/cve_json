    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-121 Stack-based Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "description": "An authenticated attacker may trigger a stack based buffer overflow by performing a malformed request to either the HTTP service (TCP port 80), the HTTPS service (TCP port 443), or the IPP service (TCP port 631). The malformed request will contain an empty Origin header value and a malformed Referer header value. The Referer header value will trigger a stack based buffer overflow when the host value in the Referer header is processed and is greater than 64 bytes in length.",
