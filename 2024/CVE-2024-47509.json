Affected FPCs need to be manually restarted to recover.GUID exhaustion will trigger a syslog message like one of the following:evo-pfemand[<pid>]: get_next_guid: Ran out of Guid Space ...evo-aftmand-zx[<pid>]: get_next_guid: Ran out of Guid Space ...The leak can be monitored by running the following command and taking note of the values in the rightmost column labeled Guids:user@host> show platform application-info allocations app evo-pfemand/evo-pfemandIn case one or more of these values are constantly increasing the leak is happening.This issue affects Junos OS Evolved:  *  All versions before 21.4R2-EVO,  *  22.1 versions before 22.1R2-EVO.Please note that this issue is similar to, but different from CVE-2024-47505 and CVE-2024-47508.",
