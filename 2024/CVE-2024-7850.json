        "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
    ],
    "description": "The BP Profile Search plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 5.7.5. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the bps_ajax_field_selector(), bps_ajax_template_options(), and bps_ajax_field_row() functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
