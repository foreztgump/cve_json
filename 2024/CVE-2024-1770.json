        "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
    ],
    "description": "The Meta Tag Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.2 via deserialization of untrusted input in the get_post_data function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor access or higher, to inject a PHP Object. No POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.",
