    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:kunit/overflow: Fix UB in overflow_allocation_testThe 'device_name' array doesn't exist out of the'overflow_allocation_test' function scope. However, it is being used asa driver name when calling 'kunit_driver_create' from'kunit_device_register'. It produces the kernel panic with KASANenabled.Since this variable is used in one place only, remove it and pass thedevice name into kunit_device_register directly as an ascii string.",
