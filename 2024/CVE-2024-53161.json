    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:EDAC/bluefield: Fix potential integer overflowThe 64-bit argument for the \"get DIMM info\" SMC call consists of mem_ctrl_idxleft-shifted 16 bits and OR-ed with DIMM index.  With mem_ctrl_idx defined as32-bits wide the left-shift operation truncates the upper 16 bits ofinformation during the calculation of the SMC argument.The mem_ctrl_idx stack variable must be defined as 64-bits wide to prevent anypotential integer overflow, i.e. loss of data from upper 16 bits.",
