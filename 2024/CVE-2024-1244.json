        "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation",
        "CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path"
    ],
    "description": "Improper input validation in the OSSEC HIDS agent for Windows prior to version 3.8.0 allows an attacker in with control over the OSSEC server or in possession of the agent's key to configure the agent to connect to a malicious UNC path. This results in the leakage of the machine account NetNTLMv2 hash, which can be relayed for remote code execution or used to escalate privileges to SYSTEM via AD CS certificate forging and other similar attacks.",
