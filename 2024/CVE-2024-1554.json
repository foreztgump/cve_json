    "id": "CVE-2024-1554",
    "product": "Firefox",
    "version": "unspecified< 123 ",
    "vulnerability": [
        "fetch could be used to effect cache poisoning"
    ],
    "description": "The `fetch()` API and navigation incorrectly shared the same cache, as the cache key did not include the optional headers `fetch()` may contain.  Under the correct circumstances, an attacker may have been able to poison the local browser cache by priming it with a `fetch()` response controlled by the additional headers. Upon navigation to the same URL, the user would see the cached response instead of the expected response. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 123.",
