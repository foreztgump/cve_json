    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm/swapfile: skip HugeTLB pages for unuse_vmaI got a bad pud error and lost a 1GB HugeTLB when calling swapoff.  Theproblem can be reproduced by the following steps: 1. Allocate an anonymous 1GB HugeTLB and some other anonymous memory. 2. Swapout the above anonymous memory. 3. run swapoff and we will get a bad pud error in kernel message:  mm/pgtable-generic.c:42: bad pud 00000000743d215d(84000001400000e7)We can tell that pud_clear_bad is called by pud_none_or_clear_bad inunuse_pud_range() by ftrace.  And therefore the HugeTLB pages will neverbe freed because we lost it from page table.  We can skip HugeTLB pagesfor unuse_vma to fix it.",
