    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:PCI: Fix reset_method_store() memory leakIn reset_method_store(), a string is allocated via kstrndup() and assignedto the local \"options\". options is then used in with strsep() to findspaces:  while ((name = strsep(&options, \" \")) != NULL) {If there are no remaining spaces, then options is set to NULL by strsep(),so the subsequent kfree(options) doesn't free the memory allocated viakstrndup().Fix by using a separate tmp_options to iterate with strsep() so options ispreserved.",
