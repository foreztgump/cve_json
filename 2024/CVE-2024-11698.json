        "Fullscreen Lock-Up When Modal Dialog Interrupts Transition on macOS"
    ],
    "description": "A flaw in handling fullscreen transitions may have inadvertently caused the application to become stuck in fullscreen mode when a modal dialog was opened during the transition. This issue left users unable to exit fullscreen mode using standard actions like pressing \"Esc\" or accessing right-click menus, resulting in a disrupted browsing experience until the browser is restarted.  *This bug only affects the application when running on macOS. Other operating systems are unaffected.* This vulnerability affects Firefox < 133, Firefox ESR < 128.5, Thunderbird < 133, and Thunderbird < 128.5.",
