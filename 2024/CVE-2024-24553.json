    "id": "CVE-2024-24553",
    "product": "Bludit",
    "version": "= 2.0 ",
    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-916 Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort"
    ],
    "description": "Bludit uses the SHA-1 hashing algorithm to compute password hashes. Thus, attackers could determine cleartext passwords with brute-force attacks due to the inherent speed of SHA-1. In addition, the salt that is computed by Bludit is generated with a non-cryptographically secure function.",
