    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:arm64/sme: Always exit sme_alloc() early with existing storageWhen sme_alloc() is called with existing storage and we are not flushing wewill always allocate new storage, both leaking the existing storage andcorrupting the state. Fix this by separating the checks for flushing andfor existing storage as we do for SVE.Callers that reallocate (eg, due to changing the vector length) shouldcall sme_free() themselves.",
