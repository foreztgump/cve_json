        "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization"
    ],
    "description": "A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in multiple WSO2 products due to a business logic flaw in SOAP admin services. A malicious actor can create a new user with elevated permissions only when all of the following conditions are met:  *  SOAP admin services are accessible to the attacker.  *  The deployment includes an internally used attribute that is not part of the default WSO2 product configuration.  *  At least one custom role exists with non-default permissions.  *  The attacker has knowledge of the custom role and the internal attribute used in the deployment.Exploiting this vulnerability allows malicious actors to assign higher privileges to self-registered users, bypassing intended access control mechanisms.",
