        "CWE-117 Improper Output Neutralization for Logs"
    ],
    "description": "corydolphin/flask-cors is vulnerable to log injection when the log level is set to debug. An attacker can inject fake log entries into the log file by sending a specially crafted GET request containing a CRLF sequence in the request path. This vulnerability allows attackers to corrupt log files, potentially covering tracks of other attacks, confusing log post-processing tools, and forging log entries. The issue is due to improper output neutralization for logs.",
