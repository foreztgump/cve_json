    "description": "The configuration file is encrypted with a static key derived from a static five-character password which allows an attacker to decrypt this file.\u00c2\u00a0The application hashes this five-character password with the outdated and broken MD5 algorithm (no salt) and uses the first five bytes as the key for RC4. The configuration file is then encrypted with these parameters.",
