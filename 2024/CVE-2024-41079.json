    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:nvmet: always initialize cqe.resultThe spec doesn't mandate that the first two double words (aka results)for the command queue entry need to be set to 0 when they are notused (not specified). Though, the target implemention returns 0 for TCPand FC but not for RDMA.Let's make RDMA behave the same and thus explicitly initializing theresult field. This prevents leaking any data from the stack.",
