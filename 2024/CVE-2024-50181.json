    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:clk: imx: Remove CLK_SET_PARENT_GATE for DRAM mux for i.MX7DFor i.MX7D DRAM related mux clock, the clock source change should ONLYbe done done in low level asm code without accessing DRAM, and thencalling clk API to sync the HW clock status with clk tree, it should nevertouch real clock source switch via clk API, so CLK_SET_PARENT_GATE flagshould NOT be added, otherwise, DRAM's clock parent will be disabled whenDRAM is active, and system will hang.",
