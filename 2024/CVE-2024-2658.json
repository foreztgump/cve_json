    "description": "A misconfiguration in lmadmin.exe of FlexNet Publisher versions prior to\u00c2\u00a02024 R1 (11.19.6.0) allows the OpenSSL configuration file to load from a non-existent directory. An unauthorized, locally authenticated user with low privileges can potentially create the directory and load a specially crafted openssl.conf file leading to the execution of a malicious DLL (Dynamic-Link Library) with elevated privileges.",
