    "description": "The HUSKY \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Products Filter Professional for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.6.1 via the woof_messenger_remove_subscr AJAX action due to missing validation on the 'key' user controlled key.

This vulnerability requires the plugin's Products Messenger extension to be enabled.",
