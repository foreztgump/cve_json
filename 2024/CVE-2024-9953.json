    "description": "A potential denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability exists in CERT VINCE software versions prior to 3.0.8. An authenticated administrative user can inject an arbitrary pickle object into a user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profile, which may lead to a DoS condition when the profile is accessed. While the Django server restricts unpickling to prevent server crashes, this vulnerability could still disrupt operations.",
