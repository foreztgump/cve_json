    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:remoteproc: imx_rproc: Skip over memory region when node value is NULLIn imx_rproc_addr_init() \"nph = of_count_phandle_with_args()\" just countsnumber of phandles. But phandles may be empty. So of_parse_phandle() inthe parsing loop (0 < a < nph) may return NULL which is later dereferenced.Adjust this issue by adding NULL-return check.Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.[Fixed title to fit within the prescribed 70-75 charcters]",
