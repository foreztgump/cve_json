    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:io_uring/kbuf: hold io_buffer_list reference over mmapIf we look up the kbuf, ensure that it doesn't get unregistered untilafter we're done with it. Since we're inside mmap, we cannot safely usethe io_uring lock. Rely on the fact that we can lookup the buffer listunder RCU now and grab a reference to it, preventing it from beingunregistered until we're done with it. The lookup returns theio_buffer_list directly with it referenced.",
