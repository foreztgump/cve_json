    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ASoC: SOF: Intel: hda-dai: Do not release the link DMA on STOPThe linkDMA should not be released on stop trigger since a stream re-startmight happen without closing of the stream. This leaves a short time forother streams to 'steal' the linkDMA since it has been released.This issue is not easy to reproduce under normal conditions as usuallyafter stop the stream is closed, or the same stream is restarted, but ifanother stream got in between the stop and start, like this:aplay -Dhw:0,3 -c2 -r48000 -fS32_LE /dev/zero -d 120CTRL+zaplay -Dhw:0,0 -c2 -r48000 -fS32_LE /dev/zero -d 120then the link DMA channels will be mixed up, resulting firmware error orcrash.",
