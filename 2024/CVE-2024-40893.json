        "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')"
    ],
    "description": "Multiple authenticated operating system (OS) command injection vulnerabilities exist in Firewalla Box Software versions before 1.979. A physically close attacker that is authenticated to the Bluetooth Low-Energy (BTLE) interface can use the network configuration service to inject commands in various configuration parameters including\u00a0networkConfig.Interface.Phy.Eth0.Extra.PingTestIP,\u00a0networkConfig.Interface.Phy.Eth0.Extra.DNSTestDomain, and\u00a0networkConfig.Interface.Phy.Eth0.Gateway6. Additionally, because the configuration can be synced to the Firewalla cloud, the attacker may be able to persist access even after hardware resets and firmware re-flashes.",
