    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/mlx5: DR, prevent potential error pointer dereferenceThe dr_domain_add_vport_cap() function generally returns NULL on errorbut sometimes we want it to return ERR_PTR(-EBUSY) so the caller canretry.  The problem here is that \"ret\" can be either -EBUSY or -ENOMEMand if it's and -ENOMEM then the error pointer is propogated back andeventually dereferenced in dr_ste_v0_build_src_gvmi_qpn_tag().",
