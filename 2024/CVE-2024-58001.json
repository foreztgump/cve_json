    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ocfs2: handle a symlink read error correctlyPatch series \"Convert ocfs2 to use folios\".Mark did a conversion of ocfs2 to use folios and sent it to me as agiant patch for review ;-)So I've redone it as individual patches, and credited Mark for the patcheswhere his code is substantially the same.  It's not a bad way to do it;his patch had some bugs and my patches had some bugs.  Hopefully all ourbugs were different from each other.  And hopefully Mark likes all thechanges I made to his code!This patch (of 23):If we can't read the buffer, be sure to unlock the page before returning.",
