    "description": "Weak JWT Secret vulnerabilitiy in EasyVirt DCScope <= 8.6.0 and CO2Scope <= 1.3.0 allows remote attackers to generate JWT for privilege escalation. The HMAC secret used for generating tokens is hardcoded as \"somerandomaccesstoken\". A weak HMAC secret poses a risk because attackers can use the predictable secret to create valid JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), allowing them access to important information and actions within the application.",
