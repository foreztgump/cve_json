If NR_CPUS threads calldo_task_stat() at the same time and the process has NR_THREADS, it willspin with irqs disabled O(NR_CPUS * NR_THREADS) time.Change do_task_stat() to use sig->stats_lock to gather the statisticsoutside of ->siglock protected section, in the likely case this code willrun lockless.",
