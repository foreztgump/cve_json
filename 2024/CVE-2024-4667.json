    "description": "The Blog, Posts and Category Filter for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the Post and Category Filter widget in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied 'post_types' attribute. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
