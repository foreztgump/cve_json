    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-384 Session Fixation"
    ],
    "description": "Internet Starter, one of SoftCOM iKSORIS system modules,\u00a0allows for setting an arbitrary session cookie value. An attacker with an access to user's browser might set such a cookie, wait until the user logs in and then use the same cookie to take over the account. Moreover, the system does not destroy the old sessions when creating new ones, what expands the time frame in which an attack might be performed.\u00a0This vulnerability has been patched in version 79.0",
