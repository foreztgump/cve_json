    "description": "An unauthenticated attacker may perform a blind server side request forgery (SSRF), due to a CLRF injection issue that can be leveraged to perform HTTP request smuggling. This SSRF leverages the WS-Addressing feature used during a WS-Eventing subscription SOAP operation. The attacker can control all the HTTP data sent in the SSRF connection, but the attacker can not receive any data back from this connection.",
