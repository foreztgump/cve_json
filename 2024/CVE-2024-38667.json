    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:riscv: prevent pt_regs corruption for secondary idle threadsTop of the kernel thread stack should be reserved for pt_regs. Howeverthis is not the case for the idle threads of the secondary boot harts.Their stacks overlap with their pt_regs, so both may get corrupted.Similar issue has been fixed for the primary hart, see c7cdd96eca28(\"riscv: prevent stack corruption by reserving task_pt_regs(p) early\").However that fix was not propagated to the secondary harts. The problemhas been noticed in some CPU hotplug tests with V enabled. The functionsmp_callin stored several registers on stack, corrupting top of pt_regsstructure including status field. As a result, kernel attempted to saveor restore inexistent V context.",
