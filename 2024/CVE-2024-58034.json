    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:memory: tegra20-emc: fix an OF node reference bug in tegra_emc_find_node_by_ram_code()As of_find_node_by_name() release the reference of the argument devicenode, tegra_emc_find_node_by_ram_code() releases some device nodes whilestill in use, resulting in possible UAFs. According to the bindings andthe in-tree DTS files, the \"emc-tables\" node is always device's childnode with the property \"nvidia,use-ram-code\", and the \"lpddr2\" node is achild of the \"emc-tables\" node. Thus utilize thefor_each_child_of_node() macro and of_get_child_by_name() instead ofof_find_node_by_name() to simplify the code.This bug was found by an experimental verification tool that I amdeveloping.[krzysztof: applied v1, adjust the commit msg to incorporate v2 parts]",
