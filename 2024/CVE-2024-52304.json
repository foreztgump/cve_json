    "version": "< 3.10.11 ",
    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-444: Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')"
    ],
    "description": "aiohttp is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and Python. Prior to version 3.10.11, the Python parser parses newlines in chunk extensions incorrectly which can lead to request smuggling vulnerabilities under certain conditions. If a pure Python version of aiohttp is installed (i.e. without the usual C extensions) or `AIOHTTP_NO_EXTENSIONS` is enabled, then an attacker may be able to execute a request smuggling attack to bypass certain firewalls or proxy protections. Version 3.10.11 fixes the issue.",
