    "description": "GNOME libsoup before 3.6.1 allows a buffer overflow in applications that perform conversion to UTF-8 in soup_header_parse_param_list_strict. There is a plausible way to reach this remotely via soup_message_headers_get_content_type (e.g., an application may want to retrieve the content type of a request or response).",
