    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-821 Incorrect Synchronization"
    ],
    "description": "In lunary-ai/lunary versions <=v1.2.11, an attacker can bypass email validation by using a dot character ('.') in the email address. This allows the creation of multiple accounts with essentially the same email address (e.g., 'attacker123@gmail.com' and 'attacker.123@gmail.com'), leading to incorrect synchronization and potential security issues.",
