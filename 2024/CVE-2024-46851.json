    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/amd/display: Avoid race between dcn10_set_drr() and dc_state_destruct()dc_state_destruct() nulls the resource context of the DC state. The pipecontext passed to dcn10_set_drr() is a member of this resource context.If dc_state_destruct() is called parallel to the IRQ processing (whichcalls dcn10_set_drr() at some point), we can end up using already nulledfunction callback fields of struct stream_resource.The logic in dcn10_set_drr() already tries to avoid this, by checking tgagainst NULL. But if the nulling happens exactly after the NULL check andbefore the next access, then we get a race.Avoid this by copying tg first to a local variable, and then use thisvariable for all the operations. This should work, as long as nobodyfrees the resource pool where the timing generators live.(cherry picked from commit a3cc326a43bdc48fbdf53443e1027a03e309b643)",
