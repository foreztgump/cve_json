The user can also add other users to the event from the same domain, including administrator. A normal user can create an event with XSS payload inside \u201cTitre\u201d and \u201cDescription\u201d parameters and add the administrator or any user to the event. When the other user (victim) visits his own profile (even without clicking on the event) the payload will be executed on the victim side.",
