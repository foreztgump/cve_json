        "n/a"
    ],
    "description": "In illumos illumos-gate 2024-02-15, an error occurs in the elliptic curve point addition algorithm that uses mixed Jacobian-affine coordinates, causing the algorithm to yield a result of POINT_AT_INFINITY when it should not. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this to interfere with a connection, resulting in an attacked party computing an incorrect shared secret.",
