    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-613 Insufficient Session Expiration"
    ],
    "description": "A vulnerability in zenml-io/zenml version 0.56.3 allows attackers to reuse old session credentials or session IDs due to insufficient session expiration. Specifically, the session does not expire after a password change, enabling an attacker to maintain access to a compromised account without the victim's ability to revoke this access. This issue was observed in a self-hosted ZenML deployment via Docker, where after changing the password from one browser, the session remained active and usable in another browser without requiring re-authentication.",
