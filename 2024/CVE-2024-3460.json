    "description": "In KioWare for Windows (versions all through 8.34)\u00a0it is possible to exit this software\u00a0and use other already opened applications utilizing a short time window before the forced automatic logout occurs. Then, by using some built-in function of these applications, one may launch any other programs.\u00a0In order to exploit this vulnerability external applications must be left running when the KioWare software is launched. Additionally, an attacker must know\u00a0the PIN set for this Kioware instance and also slow down the application with some specific task which extends the usable time window.",
