    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/dp_mst: Ensure mst_primary pointer is valid in drm_dp_mst_handle_up_req()While receiving an MST up request message from one thread indrm_dp_mst_handle_up_req(), the MST topology could be removed fromanother thread via drm_dp_mst_topology_mgr_set_mst(false), freeingmst_primary and setting drm_dp_mst_topology_mgr::mst_primary to NULL.This could lead to a NULL deref/use-after-free of mst_primary indrm_dp_mst_handle_up_req().Avoid the above by holding a reference for mst_primary indrm_dp_mst_handle_up_req() while it's used.v2: Fix kfreeing the request if getting an mst_primary reference fails.",
