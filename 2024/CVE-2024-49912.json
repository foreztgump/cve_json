    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/amd/display: Handle null 'stream_status' in 'planes_changed_for_existing_stream'This commit adds a null check for 'stream_status' in the function'planes_changed_for_existing_stream'. Previously, the code assumed'stream_status' could be null, but did not handle the case where it wasactually null. This could lead to a null pointer dereference.Reported by smatch:drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/core/dc_resource.c:3784 planes_changed_for_existing_stream() error: we previously assumed 'stream_status' could be null (see line 3774)",
