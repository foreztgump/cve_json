    ],
    "description": "The WS Form LITE \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Drag & Drop Contact Form Builder for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the url parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.10.13 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.

NOTE: This vulnerability is partially fixed in 1.10.13 and completely fixed in 1.10.14.",
