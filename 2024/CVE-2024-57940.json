    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:exfat: fix the infinite loop in exfat_readdir()If the file system is corrupted so that a cluster is linked toitself in the cluster chain, and there is an unused directoryentry in the cluster, 'dentry' will not be incremented, causingcondition 'dentry < max_dentries' unable to prevent an infiniteloop.This infinite loop causes s_lock not to be released, and othertasks will hang, such as exfat_sync_fs().This commit stops traversing the cluster chain when there is unuseddirectory entry in the cluster to avoid this infinite loop.",
