        "Use of Uninitialized Variable"
    ],
    "description": "A vulnerability was found in Golang FIPS OpenSSL. This flaw allows a malicious user to randomly cause an uninitialized buffer length variable with a zeroed buffer to be returned in FIPS mode. It may also be possible to force a false positive match between non-equal hashes when comparing a trusted computed hmac sum to an untrusted input sum if an attacker can send a zeroed buffer in place of a pre-computed sum.\u00a0 It is also possible to force a derived key to be all zeros instead of an unpredictable value.\u00a0 This may have follow-on implications for the Go TLS stack.",
