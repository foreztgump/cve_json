    "version": "Noetic Ninjemys< 3d93ac13603438323d7e9fa74e879e45c5fe2e8e ",
    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation",
        "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
    ],
    "description": "A YAML deserialization vulnerability was found in the Robot Operating System (ROS) 'dynparam', a command-line tool for getting, setting, and deleting parameters of a dynamically configurable node, affecting ROS distributions Noetic and earlier. The issue is caused by the use of the yaml.load() function in the 'set' and 'get' verbs, and allows for the creation of arbitrary Python objects. Through this flaw, a local or remote user can craft and execute arbitrary Python code. This issue has now been fixed for ROS Noetic via commit 3d93ac13603438323d7e9fa74e879e45c5fe2e8e.",
