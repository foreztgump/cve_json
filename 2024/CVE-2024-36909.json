    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:Drivers: hv: vmbus: Don't free ring buffers that couldn't be re-encryptedIn CoCo VMs it is possible for the untrusted host to causeset_memory_encrypted() or set_memory_decrypted() to fail such that anerror is returned and the resulting memory is shared. Callers need totake care to handle these errors to avoid returning decrypted (shared)memory to the page allocator, which could lead to functional or securityissues.The VMBus ring buffer code could free decrypted/shared pages ifset_memory_decrypted() fails. Check the decrypted field in the structvmbus_gpadl for the ring buffers to decide whether to free the memory.",
