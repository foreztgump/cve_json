There's noreference counting, we just need to wait for the completion to wake usup and return its result.We should preferably also use a separate crypto_wait. I'm not seeing aUAF as I did in the past, I think aec7961916f3 (\"tls: fix race betweenasync notify and socket close\") took care of it.This will make the next fix easier.",
