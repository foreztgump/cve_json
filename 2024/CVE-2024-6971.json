    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
    ],
    "description": "A path traversal vulnerability exists in the parisneo/lollms-webui repository, specifically in the `lollms_file_system.py` file. The functions `add_rag_database`, `toggle_mount_rag_database`, and `vectorize_folder` do not implement security measures such as `sanitize_path_from_endpoint` or `sanitize_path`. This allows an attacker to perform vectorize operations on `.sqlite` files in any directory on the victim's computer, potentially installing multiple packages and causing a crash.",
