    "description": "Concrete CMS in version 9 before 9.2.5 is vulnerable to reflected XSS via the Image URL Import Feature due to insufficient validation of administrator provided data.

The Concrete CMS Security team scored this 2 with CVSS v3 vector AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N. This does not affect Concrete versions prior to version 9.",
