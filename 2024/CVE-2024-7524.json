        "CSP strict-dynamic bypass using web-compatibility shims"
    ],
    "description": "Firefox adds web-compatibility shims in place of some tracking scripts blocked by Enhanced Tracking Protection.  On a site protected by Content Security Policy in \"strict-dynamic\" mode, an attacker able to inject an HTML element could have used a DOM Clobbering attack on some of the shims and achieved XSS, bypassing the CSP strict-dynamic protection. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 129, Firefox ESR < 115.14, and Firefox ESR < 128.1.",
