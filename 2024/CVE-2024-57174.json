    "description": "A misconfiguration in Alphion ASEE-1443 Firmware v0.4.H.00.02.15 defines a previously unregistered domain name as the default DNS suffix. This allows attackers to register the unclaimed domain and point its wildcard DNS entry to an attacker-controlled IP address, making it possible to access sensitive information.",
