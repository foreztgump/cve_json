    "description": "The WP User Profile Avatar plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.5. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the wpupa_user_admin() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the plugins setting which controls access to the functionality via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
