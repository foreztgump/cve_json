    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: seeq: Fix use after free vulnerability in ether3 Driver Due to Race ConditionIn the ether3_probe function, a timer is initialized with a callbackfunction ether3_ledoff, bound to &prev(dev)->timer. Once the timer isstarted, there is a risk of a race condition if the module or deviceis removed, triggering the ether3_remove function to perform cleanup.The sequence of operations that may lead to a UAF bug is as follows:CPU0                                    CPU1                      |  ether3_ledoffether3_remove         |  free_netdev(dev);   |  put_devic           |  kfree(dev);         | |  ether3_outw(priv(dev)->regs.config2 |= CFG2_CTRLO, REG_CONFIG2);                      | // use devFix it by ensuring that the timer is canceled before proceeding withthe cleanup in ether3_remove.",
