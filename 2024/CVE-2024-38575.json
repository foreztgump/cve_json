    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:wifi: brcmfmac: pcie: handle randbuf allocation failureThe kzalloc() in brcmf_pcie_download_fw_nvram() will return nullif the physical memory has run out. As a result, if we useget_random_bytes() to generate random bytes in the randbuf, thenull pointer dereference bug will happen.In order to prevent allocation failure, this patch adds a separatefunction using buffer on kernel stack to generate random bytes inthe randbuf, which could prevent the kernel stack from overflow.",
