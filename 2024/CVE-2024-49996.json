    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:cifs: Fix buffer overflow when parsing NFS reparse pointsReparseDataLength is sum of the InodeType size and DataBuffer size.So to get DataBuffer size it is needed to subtract InodeType's size fromReparseDataLength.Function cifs_strndup_from_utf16() is currentlly accessing buf->DataBufferat position after the end of the buffer because it does not subtractInodeType size from the length. Fix this problem and correctly subtractvariable len.Member InodeType is present only when reparse buffer is large enough. Checkfor ReparseDataLength before accessing InodeType to prevent another invalidmemory access.Major and minor rdev values are present also only when reparse buffer islarge enough. Check for reparse buffer size before calling reparse_mkdev().",
