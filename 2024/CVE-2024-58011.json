    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:platform/x86: int3472: Check for adev == NULLNot all devices have an ACPI companion fwnode, so adev might be NULL. Thiscan e.g. (theoretically) happen when a user manually binds one ofthe int3472 drivers to another i2c/platform device through sysfs.Add a check for adev not being set and return -ENODEV in that case toavoid a possible NULL pointer deref in skl_int3472_get_acpi_buffer().",
