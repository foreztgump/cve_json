    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/amd/display: Add NULL check for function pointer in dcn20_set_output_transfer_funcThis commit adds a null check for the set_output_gamma function pointerin the dcn20_set_output_transfer_func function. Previously,set_output_gamma was being checked for null at line 1030, but then itwas being dereferenced without any null check at line 1048. This couldpotentially lead to a null pointer dereference error if set_output_gammais null.To fix this, we now ensure that set_output_gamma is not null beforedereferencing it. We do this by adding a null check for set_output_gammabefore the call to set_output_gamma at line 1048.",
