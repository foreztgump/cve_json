    "version": "* ",
    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')"
    ],
    "description": "Multiple plugins and/or themes for WordPress are vulnerable to unauthorized access due to a missing capability check on several AJAX actions like 'gsf_reset_section_options', 'gsf_reset_section_options', 'gsf_create_preset_options' and more in various versions. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to reset and modify some of the plugin/theme settings. This issue was escalated to Envato over two months from the date of this disclosure and the issues, while partially patched, are still vulnerable.",
