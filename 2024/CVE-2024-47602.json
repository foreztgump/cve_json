    "description": "GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. A null pointer dereference vulnerability has been discovered in the gst_matroska_demux_add_wvpk_header function within matroska-demux.c. This function does not properly check the validity of the stream->codec_priv pointer in the following code. If stream->codec_priv is NULL, the call to GST_READ_UINT16_LE will attempt to dereference a null pointer, leading to a crash of the application. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.",
