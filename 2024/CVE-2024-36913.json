    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:Drivers: hv: vmbus: Leak pages if set_memory_encrypted() failsIn CoCo VMs it is possible for the untrusted host to causeset_memory_encrypted() or set_memory_decrypted() to fail such that anerror is returned and the resulting memory is shared. Callers need totake care to handle these errors to avoid returning decrypted (shared)memory to the page allocator, which could lead to functional or securityissues.VMBus code could free decrypted pages if set_memory_encrypted()/decrypted()fails. Leak the pages if this happens.",
