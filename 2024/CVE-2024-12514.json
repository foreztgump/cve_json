        "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
    ],
    "description": "The 3DVieweronline plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's '3Dvo-model' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
