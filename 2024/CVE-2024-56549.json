    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:cachefiles: Fix NULL pointer dereference in object->fileAt present, the object->file has the NULL pointer dereference problem inondemand-mode. The root cause is that the allocated fd and object->filelifetime are inconsistent, and the user-space invocation to anon_fd usesobject->file. Following is the process that triggers the issue:\t  [write fd]\t\t\t\t[umount]cachefiles_ondemand_fd_write_iter\t\t\t\t       fscache_cookie_state_machine\t\t\t\t\t cachefiles_withdraw_cookie  if (!file) return -ENOBUFS\t\t\t\t\t   cachefiles_clean_up_object\t\t\t\t\t     cachefiles_unmark_inode_in_use\t\t\t\t\t     fput(object->file)\t\t\t\t\t     object->file = NULL  // file NULL pointer dereference!  __cachefiles_write(..., file, ...)Fix this issue by add an additional reference count to the object->filebefore write/llseek, and decrement after it finished.",
