    "description": "A Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of the Juniper Networks Junos OS on the SRX5K, SRX4600 and MX Series platforms with Trio-based FPCs allows an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).In case of channelized Modular Interface Cards (MICs), every physical interface flap operation will leak heap memory. Over a period of time, continuous physical interface flap operations causes\u00a0local FPC  to eventually run out of memory and crash.\u00a0\u00a0Below CLI command can be used to check the memory usage over a period of time:\u2003\u2003user@host> show chassis fpc\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Temp  CPU Utilization (%) \u00a0 CPU Utilization (%)  Memory \u00a0 Utilization (%)\u00a0 Slot State \u00a0 \u00a0  (C)\u00a0 Total\u00a0 Interrupt \u00a0 \u00a0  1min \u00a0 5min \u00a015min DRAM (MB) Heap \u00a0 \u00a0 Buffer\u00a0 0 Online\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a043 \u00a0 \u00a0 41 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 2 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 2048 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 49 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 14\u00a0 1 Online\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a043 \u00a0 \u00a0 41 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 2 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a02048 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 49 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 14\u00a0 2 Online\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a043 \u00a0 \u00a0 41 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 2 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a02048 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 49 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 14This issue affects Junos OS on SRX5K, SRX4600 and MX Series:\u00a0  *  All versions before 21.2R3-S7,\u00a0  *  from 21.4 before 21.4R3-S6,\u00a0  *  from 22.1 before 22.1R3-S5,\u00a0  *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S3,\u00a0  *  from 22.3 before 22.3R3-S2,\u00a0  *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3,\u00a0  *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2,\u00a0  *  from 23.4 before 23.4R2.",
