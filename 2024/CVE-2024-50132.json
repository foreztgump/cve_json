    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:tracing/probes: Fix MAX_TRACE_ARGS limit handlingWhen creating a trace_probe we would set nr_args prior to truncating thearguments to MAX_TRACE_ARGS. However, we would only initialize argumentsup to the limit.This caused invalid memory access when attempting to set up probes withmore than 128 fetchargs.
