    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:tls: stop recv() if initial process_rx_list gave us non-DATAIf we have a non-DATA record on the rx_list and another record of thesame type still on the queue, we will end up merging them: - process_rx_list copies the non-DATA record - we start the loop and process the first available record since it's   of the same type - we break out of the loop since the record was not DATAJust check the record type and jump to the end in case process_rx_listdid some work.",
