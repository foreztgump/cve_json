    ],
    "description": "libcurl's URL API function[curl_url_get()](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/curl_url_get.html) offers punycodeconversions, to and from IDN. Asking to convert a name that is exactly 256bytes, libcurl ends up reading outside of a stack based buffer when built touse the *macidn* IDN backend. The conversion function then fills up theprovided buffer exactly - but does not null terminate the string.This flaw can lead to stack contents accidently getting returned as part ofthe converted string.",
