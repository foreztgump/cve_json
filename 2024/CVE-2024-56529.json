    "description": "Mailcow through 2024-11b has a session fixation vulnerability in the web panel. It allows remote attackers to set a session identifier when HSTS is disabled on a victim's browser. After a user logs in, they are authenticated and the session identifier is valid. Then, a remote attacker can access the victim's web panel with the same session identifier.",
