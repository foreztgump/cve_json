    "description": "A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the St. Joe ERP system (\"\u5723\u4e54ERP\u7cfb\u7edf\") that allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via crafted HTTP POST requests to the login endpoint. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before incorporating it into SQL queries, enabling direct manipulation of the backend database. Successful exploitation may result in unauthorized data access, modification of records, or limited disruption of service. An affected version range is undefined.\u00a0Exploitation evidence was first observed by the Shadowserver Foundation on 2025-04-14 UTC.",
