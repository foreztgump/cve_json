    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:firmware: cs_dsp: Prevent buffer overrun when processing V2 alg headersCheck that all fields of a V2 algorithm header fit into the availablefirmware data buffer.The wmfw V2 format introduced variable-length strings in the algorithmblock header. This means the overall header length is variable, and theposition of most fields varies depending on the length of the stringfields. Each field must be checked to ensure that it does not overflowthe firmware data buffer.As this ia bugfix patch, the fixes avoid making any significant change tothe existing code. This makes it easier to review and less likely tointroduce new bugs.",
