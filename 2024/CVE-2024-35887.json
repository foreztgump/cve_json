    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ax25: fix use-after-free bugs caused by ax25_ds_del_timerWhen the ax25 device is detaching, the ax25_dev_device_down()calls ax25_ds_del_timer() to cleanup the slave_timer. Whenthe timer handler is running, the ax25_ds_del_timer() thatcalls del_timer() in it will return directly. As a result,the use-after-free bugs could happen, one of the scenariosis shown below:      (Thread 1)          |      (Thread 2)                          | ax25_ds_timeout()ax25_dev_device_down()    |  ax25_ds_del_timer()     |    del_timer()           |  ax25_dev_put() //FREE   |                          |  ax25_dev-> //USEIn order to mitigate bugs, when the device is detaching, usetimer_shutdown_sync() to stop the timer.",
