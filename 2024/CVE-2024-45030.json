    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:igb: cope with large MAX_SKB_FRAGSSabrina reports that the igb driver does not cope well with largeMAX_SKB_FRAG values: setting MAX_SKB_FRAG to 45 causes payloadcorruption on TX.An easy reproducer is to run ssh to connect to the machine.  WithMAX_SKB_FRAGS=17 it works, with MAX_SKB_FRAGS=45 it fails.  This hasbeen reported originally inhttps://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2265320The root cause of the issue is that the driver does not take intoaccount properly the (possibly large) shared info size when selectingthe ring layout, and will try to fit two packets inside the same 4Kpage even when the 1st fraglist will trump over the 2nd head.Address the issue by checking if 2K buffers are insufficient.",
