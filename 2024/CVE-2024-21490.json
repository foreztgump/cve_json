    "id": "CVE-2024-21490",
    "product": "angular",
    "version": "1.3.0< * ",
    "vulnerability": [
        "Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)"
    ],
    "description": "This affects versions of the package angular from 1.3.0. A regular expression used to split the value of the ng-srcset directive is vulnerable to super-linear runtime due to backtracking. With large carefully-crafted input, this can result in catastrophic backtracking and cause a denial of service.  \n**Note:** This package is EOL and will not receive any updates to address this issue. Users should migrate to [@angular/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular/core).",
