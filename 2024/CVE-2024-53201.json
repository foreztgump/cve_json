    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/amd/display: Fix null check for pipe_ctx->plane_state in dcn20_program_pipeThis commit addresses a null pointer dereference issue indcn20_program_pipe(). Previously, commit 8e4ed3cf1642 (\"drm/amd/display:Add null check for pipe_ctx->plane_state in dcn20_program_pipe\")partially fixed the null pointer dereference issue. However, indcn20_update_dchubp_dpp(), the variable pipe_ctx is passed in, andplane_state is accessed again through pipe_ctx. Multiple if statementsdirectly call attributes of plane_state, leading to potential nullpointer dereference issues. This patch adds necessary null checks toensure stability.",
