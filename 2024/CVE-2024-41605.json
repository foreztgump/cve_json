    "description": "In Foxit PDF Reader before 2024.3, and PDF Editor before 2024.3 and 13.x before 13.1.4, an attacker can replace an update file with a Trojan horse via side loading, because the update service lacks integrity validation for the updater. Attacker-controlled code may thus be executed.",
