    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-1245: Improper Finite State Machines (FSMs) in Hardware Logic"
    ],
    "description": "Dormakaba Saflok System 6000 contains a predictable key generation algorithm that allows attackers to derive card access keys from a 32-bit unique identifier. Attackers can exploit the deterministic key generation process by calculating valid access keys using a simple mathematical transformation of the card's unique identifier.",
