    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/amdgpu/gfx9: Add Cleaner Shader Deinitialization in gfx_v9_0 ModuleThis commit addresses an omission in the previous patch related to thecleaner shader support for GFX9 hardware. Specifically, it adds thenecessary deinitialization code for the cleaner shader in thegfx_v9_0_sw_fini function.The added line amdgpu_gfx_cleaner_shader_sw_fini(adev); ensures that anyallocated resources for the cleaner shader are freed correctly, avoidingpotential memory leaks and ensuring that the GPU state is clean for thenext initialization sequence.",
