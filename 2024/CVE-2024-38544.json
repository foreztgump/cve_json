    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:RDMA/rxe: Fix seg fault in rxe_comp_queue_pktIn rxe_comp_queue_pkt() an incoming response packet skb is enqueued to theresp_pkts queue and then a decision is made whether to run the completertask inline or schedule it. Finally the skb is dereferenced to bump a 'hw'performance counter. This is wrong because if the completer task isalready running in a separate thread it may have already processed the skband freed it which can cause a seg fault.  This has been observedinfrequently in testing at high scale.This patch fixes this by changing the order of enqueuing the packet untilafter the counter is accessed.",
