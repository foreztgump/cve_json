    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read"
    ],
    "description": "GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. An OOB-read has been detected in the function qtdemux_parse_samples within qtdemux.c. This issue arises when the function qtdemux_parse_samples reads data beyond the boundaries of the stream->stco buffer. The following code snippet shows the call to qt_atom_parser_get_offset_unchecked, which leads to the OOB-read when parsing the provided GHSL-2024-245_crash1.mp4 file. This issue may lead to read up to 8 bytes out-of-bounds. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.",
