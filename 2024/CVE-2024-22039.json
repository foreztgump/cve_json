    "description": "A vulnerability has been identified in Cerberus PRO EN Engineering Tool (All versions < IP8), Cerberus PRO EN Fire Panel FC72x (All versions < IP8), Cerberus PRO EN X200 Cloud Distribution (All versions < V4.0.5016), Cerberus PRO EN X300 Cloud Distribution (All versions < V4.2.5015), Sinteso FS20 EN Engineering Tool (All versions < MP8), Sinteso FS20 EN Fire Panel FC20 (All versions < MP8), Sinteso FS20 EN X200 Cloud Distribution (All versions < V4.0.5016), Sinteso FS20 EN X300 Cloud Distribution (All versions < V4.2.5015), Sinteso Mobile (All versions < V3.0.0). The network communication library in affected systems does not validate the length of certain X.509 certificate attributes which might result in a stack-based buffer overflow.\nThis could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute code on the underlying operating system with root privileges.",
