    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:comedi: Flush partial mappings in error caseIf some remap_pfn_range() calls succeeded before one failed, we still havebuffer pages mapped into the userspace page tables when we drop the bufferreference with comedi_buf_map_put(bm). The userspace mappings are onlycleaned up later in the mmap error path.Fix it by explicitly flushing all mappings in our VMA on the error path.See commit 79a61cc3fc04 (\"mm: avoid leaving partial pfn mappings around inerror case\").",
