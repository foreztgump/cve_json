        "CWE-29 Path Traversal: '\\..\\filename'"
    ],
    "description": "A path traversal vulnerability in the get-project-files functionality of stitionai/devika allows attackers to read arbitrary files from the filesystem and cause a Denial of Service (DoS). This issue is present in all versions of the application. The vulnerability arises due to insufficient path sanitization for the 'project-name' parameter, enabling attackers to specify paths that traverse the filesystem. By setting 'project-name' to the root directory, an attacker can cause the application to attempt to read the entire filesystem, leading to a DoS condition.",
