    "description": "** DISPUTED ** In axios before 1.7.8, lib/helpers/isURLSameOrigin.js does not use a URL object when determining an origin, and has a potentially unwanted setAttribute('href',href) call. NOTE: some parties feel that the code change only addresses a warning message from a SAST tool and does not fix a vulnerability.",
