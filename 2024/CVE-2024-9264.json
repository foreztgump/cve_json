    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')"
    ],
    "description": "The SQL Expressions experimental feature of Grafana allows for the evaluation of `duckdb` queries containing user input. These queries are insufficiently sanitized before being passed to `duckdb`, leading to a command injection and local file inclusion vulnerability. Any user with the VIEWER or higher permission is capable of executing this attack.  The `duckdb` binary must be present in Grafana's $PATH for this attack to function; by default, this binary is not installed in Grafana distributions.",
