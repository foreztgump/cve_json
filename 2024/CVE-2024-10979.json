    "product": "PostgreSQL",
    "version": "17< 17.1 ",
    "vulnerability": [
        "External Control of System or Configuration Setting"
    ],
    "description": "Incorrect control of environment variables in PostgreSQL PL/Perl allows an unprivileged database user to change sensitive process environment variables (e.g. PATH).  That often suffices to enable arbitrary code execution, even if the attacker lacks a database server operating system user.  Versions before PostgreSQL 17.1, 16.5, 15.9, 14.14, 13.17, and 12.21 are affected.",
