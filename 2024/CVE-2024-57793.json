    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:virt: tdx-guest: Just leak decrypted memory on unrecoverable errorsIn CoCo VMs it is possible for the untrusted host to causeset_memory_decrypted() to fail such that an error is returnedand the resulting memory is shared. Callers need to take careto handle these errors to avoid returning decrypted (shared)memory to the page allocator, which could lead to functionalor security issues.Leak the decrypted memory when set_memory_decrypted() fails,and don't need to print an error since set_memory_decrypted()will call WARN_ONCE().",
