    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:lib/test_hmm.c: handle src_pfns and dst_pfns allocation failureThe kcalloc() in dmirror_device_evict_chunk() will return null if thephysical memory has run out.  As a result, if src_pfns or dst_pfns isdereferenced, the null pointer dereference bug will happen.Moreover, the device is going away.  If the kcalloc() fails, the pagesmapping a chunk could not be evicted.  So add a __GFP_NOFAIL flag inkcalloc().Finally, as there is no need to have physically contiguous memory, Switchkcalloc() to kvcalloc() in order to avoid failing allocations.",
