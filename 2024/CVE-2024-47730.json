Therefore, the driverneeds to inject the qm error to close the master ooo. Currently,the qm error is injected after stopping queue, memory may bereleased immediately after stopping queue, causing the device toaccess the released memory. Therefore, error is injected to close masterooo before stopping queue to ensure that the device does not accessthe released memory.",
