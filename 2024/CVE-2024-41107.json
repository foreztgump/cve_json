    "id": "CVE-2024-41107",
    "product": "Apache CloudStack",
    "version": "4.5.0<= 4.18.2.1 ",
    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-290 Authentication Bypass by Spoofing"
    ],
    "description": "The CloudStack SAML authentication (disabled by default) does not enforce signature check. In CloudStack environments where SAML authentication is enabled, an attacker that initiates CloudStack SAML single sign-on authentication can bypass SAML authentication by submitting a spoofed SAML response with no signature and known or guessed username and other user details of a SAML-enabled CloudStack user-account.\u00a0In such environments, this can result in a complete compromise of the resources owned and/or accessible by a SAML enabled user-account.Affected users are recommended to disable the SAML authentication plugin by setting the\u00a0\"saml2.enabled\" global setting to \"false\", or upgrade to version 4.18.2.2, 4.19.1.0 or later, which addresses this issue.",
