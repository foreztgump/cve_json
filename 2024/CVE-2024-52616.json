        "Small Space of Random Values"
    ],
    "description": "A flaw was found in the Avahi-daemon, where it initializes DNS transaction IDs randomly only once at startup, incrementing them sequentially after that. This predictable behavior facilitates DNS spoofing attacks, allowing attackers to guess transaction IDs.",
