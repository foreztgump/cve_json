    "id": "CVE-2024-13990",
    "product": "eScan AV",
    "version": "* ",
    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation",
        "CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature"
    ],
    "description": "MicroWorld eScan AV's update mechanism failed to ensure authenticity and integrity of updates: update packages were delivered and accepted without robust cryptographic verification. As a result, an on-path attacker could perform a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack and substitute malicious update payloads for legitimate ones. The eScan AV client accepted these substituted packages and executed or loaded their components (including sideloaded DLLs and Java/installer payloads), enabling remote code execution on affected systems. MicroWorld eScan confirmed remediation of the update mechanism on 2023-07-31 but versioning details are unavailable. NOTE: MicroWorld eScan disputes the characterization in third-party reports, stating the issue relates to 2018\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2019 and that controls were implemented then.",
