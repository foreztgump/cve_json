        "CWE-755 Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions"
    ],
    "description": "An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows a network-based, unauthenticated attacker to cause Denial of Service (DoS).When a BGP UPDATE with malformed path attribute is received over an established BGP session, rpd crashes and restarts. Continuous receipt of a BGP UPDATE with a specifically malformed path attribute will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition for impacted devices. While this issue affects systems running 32-bit and 64-bit systems, the probability of impact on 64-bit system is extremely low.\u00a0According to  KB25803  https://supportportal.juniper.net/s/article/Junos-How-to-check-if-Junos-OS-is-64-or-32-bit-on-a-router , customers can confirm 32-bit or 64-bit system via the ' show version detail ' command:\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003lab@router> show version detail| match 32\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003JUNOS 32-bit kernel Software Suite\u00a0\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003lab@router> show version detail| match 64\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003JUNOS 64-bit kernel Software Suite\u00a0This issue affects:\u2003Juniper Networks Junos OS:\u00a0  *  All versions before 21.4R3-S8,\u00a0  *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S4,\u00a0  *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S3,\u00a0  *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S1,\u00a0  *  from 23.4 before 23.4R1-S2, 23.4R2.\u2003Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved:\u00a0  *  All versions before 21.4R3-S8-EVO,   *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S4-EVO,   *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S3-EVO,  *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S1-EVO,   *  from 23.4 before 23.4R1-S2-EVO, 23.4R2-EVO.",
