    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:NFSv4.0: Fix a use-after-free problem in the asynchronous open()Yang Erkun reports that when two threads are opening files at the sametime, and are forced to abort before a reply is seen, then the call tonfs_release_seqid() in nfs4_opendata_free() can result in ause-after-free of the pointer to the defunct rpc task of the otherthread.The fix is to ensure that if the RPC call is aborted before the call tonfs_wait_on_sequence() is complete, then we must call nfs_release_seqid()in nfs4_open_release() before the rpc_task is freed.",
