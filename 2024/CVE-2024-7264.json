    "description": "libcurl's ASN1 parser code has the `GTime2str()` function, used for parsing anASN.1 Generalized Time field. If given an syntactically incorrect field, theparser might end up using -1 for the length of the *time fraction*, leading toa `strlen()` getting performed on a pointer to a heap buffer area that is not(purposely) null terminated.This flaw most likely leads to a crash, but can also lead to heap contentsgetting returned to the application when[CURLINFO_CERTINFO](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLINFO_CERTINFO.html) is used.",
