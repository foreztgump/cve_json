Note that the more common API \"zipfile.ZipFile\" class is unaffected.When iterating over names of entries in a zip archive (for example, methodsof \"zipfile.Path\" like \"namelist()\", \"iterdir()\", etc)the process can be put into an infinite loop with a maliciously craftedzip archive. This defect applies when reading only metadata or extractingthe contents of the zip archive. Programs that are not handlinguser-controlled zip archives are not affected.",
