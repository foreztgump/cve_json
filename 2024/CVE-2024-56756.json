    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:nvme-pci: fix freeing of the HMB descriptor tableThe HMB descriptor table is sized to the maximum number of descriptorsthat could be used for a given device, but __nvme_alloc_host_mem couldbreak out of the loop earlier on memory allocation failure and end upusing less descriptors than planned for, which leads to an incorrectsize passed to dma_free_coherent.In practice this was not showing up because the number of descriptorstends to be low and the dma coherent allocator always allocates andfrees at least a page.",
