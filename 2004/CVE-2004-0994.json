    "description": "Multiple integer overflows in xzgv 0.8 and earlier allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via images with large width and height values, which trigger a heap-based buffer overflow, as demonstrated in the read_prf_file function in readprf.c.  NOTE: CVE-2004-0994 and CVE-2004-1095 identify sets of bugs that only partially overlap, despite having the same developer.  Therefore, they should be regarded as distinct.",
