    "description": "ExBB Italia 0.22 and earlier only checks GET requests that use the QUERY_STRING for certain path manipulations, which allows remote attackers to bypass this check via (1) POST or (2) COOKIE variables, a different vector than CVE-2006-4488.  NOTE: this can be leveraged to conduct PHP remote file inclusion attacks via a URL in the (a) new_exbb[home_path] or (b) exbb[home_path] parameter to modules/threadstop/threadstop.php.",
