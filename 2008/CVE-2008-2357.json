NOTE: it could be argued that this is a vulnerability in the ns_name_ntop function in resolv/ns_name.c in glibc and the proper fix should be in glibc; if so, then this should not be treated as a vulnerability in mtr.", "poc": {"reference": ["http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2008/May/0488.html", "http://securityreason.com/securityalert/3903"], "github": ["No PoCs found on GitHub currently."]}}
