    "description": "The management console in the Volume Manager Scheduler Service (aka VxSchedService.exe) in Symantec Veritas Storage Foundation for Windows (SFW) 5.0, 5.0 RP1a, and 5.1 accepts NULL NTLMSSP authentication, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via requests to the service socket that create \"snapshots schedules\" registry values specifying future command execution.  NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2007-2279.",
