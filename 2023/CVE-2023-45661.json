        "CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read"

    "description": "stb_image is a single file MIT licensed library for processing images. A crafted image file may trigger out of bounds memcpy read in `stbi__gif_load_next`. This happens because two_back points to a memory address lower than the start of the buffer out. This issue may be used to leak internal memory allocation information.",
