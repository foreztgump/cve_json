    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:media: dw2102: Fix null-ptr-deref in dw2102_i2c_transfer()In dw2102_i2c_transfer, msg is controlled by user. When msg[i].bufis null and msg[i].len is zero, former checks on msg[i].buf would bepassed. Malicious data finally reach dw2102_i2c_transfer. If accessingmsg[i].buf[0] without sanity check, null ptr deref would happen.We add check on msg[i].len to prevent crash.Similar commit:commit 950e252cb469(\"[media] dw2102: limit messages to buffer size\")",
