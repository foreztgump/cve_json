    "vulnerability": [
        "Incorrect Default Permissions"
    ],
    "description": "A vulnerability was discovered in Samba, where the flaw allows SMB clients to truncate files, even with read-only permissions when the Samba VFS module \"acl_xattr\" is configured with \"acl_xattr:ignore system acls = yes\". The SMB protocol allows opening files when the client requests read-only access but then implicitly truncates the opened file to 0 bytes if the client specifies a separate OVERWRITE create disposition request. The issue arises in configurations that bypass kernel file system permissions checks, relying solely on Samba's permissions.",
