        "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
    ],
    "description": "The Photospace Responsive plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the \u2018psres_button_size\u2019 parameter in versions up to, and including, 2.1.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.",
