    "version": "n/a",
    "vulnerability": [
        "Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm"
    ],
    "description": "A flaw was found in shadow-utils. When asking for a new password, shadow-utils asks the password twice. If the password fails on the second attempt, shadow-utils fails in cleaning the buffer used to store the first entry. This may allow an attacker with enough access to retrieve the password from the memory.",
