    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:NFSD: Avoid calling OPDESC() with ops->opnum == OP_ILLEGALOPDESC() simply indexes into nfsd4_ops[] by the op's operationnumber, without range checking that value. It assumes callers arecareful to avoid calling it with an out-of-bounds opnum value.nfsd4_decode_compound() is not so careful, and can invoke OPDESC()with opnum set to OP_ILLEGAL, which is 10044 -- well beyond the endof nfsd4_ops[].",
