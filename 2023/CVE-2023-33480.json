{"id": "CVE-2023-33480", "product": "n/a", "version": "n/a", "vulnerability": ["n/a"], "description": "RemoteClinic 2.0 contains a critical vulnerability chain that can be exploited by a remote attacker with low-privileged user credentials to create admin users, escalate privileges, and execute arbitrary code on the target system via a PHP shell. The vulnerabilities are caused by a lack of input validation and access control in the staff/register.php endpoint and the edit-my-profile.php page. By sending a series of specially crafted requests to the RemoteClinic application, an attacker can create admin users with more privileges than their own, upload a PHP file containing arbitrary code, and execute arbitrary commands via the PHP shell.", "poc": {"reference": ["https://github.com/remoteclinic/RemoteClinic/issues/24"], "github": ["No PoCs found on GitHub currently."]}}
