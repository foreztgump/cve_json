{"id": "CVE-2023-39355", "product": "FreeRDP", "version": "= >= 3.0.0-beta1, < 3.0.0-beta3 ", "vulnerability": ["CWE-416: Use After Free"], "description": "FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), released under the Apache license. Versions of FreeRDP on the 3.x release branch before beta3 are subject to a Use-After-Free in processing `RDPGFX_CMDID_RESETGRAPHICS` packets. If `context->maxPlaneSize` is 0, `context->planesBuffer` will be freed. However, without updating `context->planesBuffer`, this leads to a Use-After-Free exploit vector. In most environments this should only result in a crash. This issue has been addressed in version 3.0.0-beta3 and users of the beta 3.x releases are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "poc": {"reference": ["https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/security/advisories/GHSA-hvwj-vmg6-2f5h"], "github": ["No PoCs found on GitHub currently."]}}
