{"id": "CVE-2023-46813", "product": "n/a", "version": "n/a", "vulnerability": ["n/a"], "description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.5.9, exploitable by local users with userspace access to MMIO registers. Incorrect access checking in the #VC handler and instruction emulation of the SEV-ES emulation of MMIO accesses could lead to arbitrary write access to kernel memory (and thus privilege escalation). This depends on a race condition through which userspace can replace an instruction before the #VC handler reads it.", "poc": {"reference": ["https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1212649"], "github": ["https://github.com/shakyaraj9569/Documentation"]}}
