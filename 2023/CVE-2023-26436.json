Access to this API endpoint is restricted to local networks by default. Arbitrary code could be injected that is being executed when processing the request. A check has been introduced to restrict processing of legal and expected classes for this API. We now log a warning in case there are attempts to inject illegal classes. No publicly available exploits are known.", "poc": {"reference": ["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/173083/OX-App-Suite-SSRF-Resource-Consumption-Command-Injection.html"], "github": ["No PoCs found on GitHub currently."]}}
