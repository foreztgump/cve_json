    "description": "A software vulnerability has been identified in the U-Boot Secondary Program Loader (SPL) before 2023.07 on select NXP i.MX 8M family processors. Under certain conditions, a crafted Flattened Image Tree (FIT) format structure can be used to overwrite SPL memory, allowing unauthenticated software to execute on the target, leading to privilege escalation. This affects i.MX 8M, i.MX 8M Mini, i.MX 8M Nano, and i.MX 8M Plus.",
