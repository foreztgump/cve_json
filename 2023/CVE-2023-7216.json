        "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
    ],
    "description": "A path traversal vulnerability was found in the CPIO utility. This issue could allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to trick a user into opening a specially crafted archive. During the extraction process, the archiver could follow symlinks outside of the intended directory, which allows files to be written in arbitrary directories through symlinks.",
