{
    "id": "CVE-2023-4052",
    "product": "Firefox ESR",
    "version": "unspecified< 115.1 ",
    "vulnerability": [
        "File deletion and privilege escalation through Firefox uninstaller"
    ],
    "description": "The Firefox updater created a directory writable by non-privileged users. When uninstalling Firefox, any files in that directory would be recursively deleted with the permissions of the uninstalling user account. This could be combined with creation of a junction (a form of symbolic link) to allow arbitrary file deletion controlled by the non-privileged user. *This bug only affects Firefox on Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected.* This vulnerability affects Firefox < 116, Firefox ESR < 115.1, and Thunderbird < 115.1.",
