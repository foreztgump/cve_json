When the application starts, it loads the data from the database into memory. Once the attacker injects too much data, the application triggers an OOM error and crashes, resulting in a persistent denial of service.", "poc": {"reference": ["https://github.com/LianKee/SO-CVEs/blob/main/CVEs/CVE-2023-29726/CVE%20detail.md"], "github": ["No PoCs found on GitHub currently."]}}
