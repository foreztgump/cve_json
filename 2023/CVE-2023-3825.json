{"id": "CVE-2023-3825", "product": "KEPServerEX", "version": "6.0<= 6.14.263 ", "vulnerability": ["CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"], "description": "PTC\u2019s KEPServerEX Versions 6.0 to 6.14.263 are vulnerable to being made to read a recursively defined object that leads to uncontrolled resource consumption. KEPServerEX uses OPC UA, a protocol which defines various object types that can be nested to create complex arrays. It does not implement a check to see if such an object is recursively defined, so an attack could send a maliciously created message that the decoder would try to decode until the stack overflowed and the device crashed.", "poc": {"reference": ["No PoCs from references."], "github": ["https://github.com/claroty/opcua-exploit-framework"]}}
