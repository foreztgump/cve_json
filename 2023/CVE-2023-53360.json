    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:NFSv4.2: Rework scratch handling for READ_PLUS (again)I found that the read code might send multiple requests using the samenfs_pgio_header, but nfs4_proc_read_setup() is only called once. This ishow we ended up occasionally double-freeing the scratch buffer, but alsomeans we set a NULL pointer but non-zero length to the xdr scratchbuffer. This results in an oops the first time decoding needs to copysomething to scratch, which frequently happens when decoding READ_PLUShole segments.I fix this by moving scratch handling into the pageio read code. Iprovide a function to allocate scratch space for decoding read replies,and free the scratch buffer when the nfs_pgio_header is freed.",
