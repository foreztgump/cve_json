NOTE: it is a documented risk that the IJS server can be specified on a gs command line (the IJS device inherently must execute a command to start the IJS server).", "poc": {"reference": ["No PoCs from references."], "github": ["https://github.com/fkie-cad/nvd-json-data-feeds", "https://github.com/jostaub/ghostscript-CVE-2023-43115", "https://github.com/nomi-sec/PoC-in-GitHub"]}}
