The socket buffer (skb) was assumed to be associated with a device before calling __ip_options_compile, which is not always the case if the skb is re-routed by ipvs. This issue may allow a local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN privileges to crash the system.", "poc": {"reference": ["https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2023/q4/14"], "github": ["No PoCs found on GitHub currently."]}}
