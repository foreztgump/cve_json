        "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type"
    ],
    "description": "The Greenshift \u00e2\u20ac\u201c animation and page builder blocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation on the 'gspb_save_files' function in versions up to, and including, 7.6.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with administrator-level capabilities or above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.",
