    "description": "`nuxt-api-party` is an open source module to proxy API requests. The library allows the user to send many options directly to `ofetch`. There is no filter on which options are available. We can abuse the retry logic to cause the server to crash from a stack overflow. fetchOptions are obtained directly from the request body. A malicious user can construct a URL known  to not fetch successfully, then set the retry attempts to a high value, this will cause a stack overflow as ofetch error handling works recursively resulting in a denial of service. This issue has been addressed in version 0.22.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should limit ofetch options.",
