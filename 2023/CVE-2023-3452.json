{"id": "CVE-2023-3452", "product": "Canto", "version": "*<= 3.0.4 ", "vulnerability": ["CWE-98 Improper Control of Filename for Include/Require Statement in PHP Program ('PHP Remote File Inclusion')"], "description": "The Canto plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion in versions up to, and including, 3.0.4 via the 'wp_abspath' parameter. This allows unauthenticated attackers to include and execute arbitrary remote code on the server, provided that allow_url_include is enabled. Local File Inclusion is also possible, albeit less useful because it requires that the attacker be able to upload a malicious php file via FTP or some other means into a directory readable by the web server.", "poc": {"reference": ["No PoCs from references."], "github": ["https://github.com/nomi-sec/PoC-in-GitHub"]}}
