    "id": "CVE-2023-6270",
    "product": "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6",
    "version": "n/a",
    "vulnerability": [
        "Improper Update of Reference Count"
    ],
    "description": "A flaw was found in the ATA over Ethernet (AoE) driver in the Linux kernel. The aoecmd_cfg_pkts() function improperly updates the refcnt on `struct net_device`, and a use-after-free can be triggered by racing between the free on the struct and the access through the `skbtxq` global queue. This could lead to a denial of service condition or potential code execution.",
