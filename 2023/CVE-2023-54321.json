    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:driver core: fix potential null-ptr-deref in device_add()I got the following null-ptr-deref report while doing fault injection test:BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000058CPU: 2 PID: 278 Comm: 37-i2c-ds2482 Tainted: G    B   W        N 6.1.0-rc3+RIP: 0010:klist_put+0x2d/0xd0Call Trace: <TASK> klist_remove+0xf1/0x1c0 device_release_driver_internal+0x196/0x210 bus_remove_device+0x1bd/0x240 device_add+0xd3d/0x1100 w1_add_master_device+0x476/0x490 [wire] ds2482_probe+0x303/0x3e0 [ds2482]This is how it happened:w1_alloc_dev()  // The dev->driver is set to w1_master_driver.  memcpy(&dev->dev, device, sizeof(struct device));  device_add()    bus_add_device()    dpm_sysfs_add() // It fails, calls bus_remove_device.    // error path    bus_remove_device()      // The dev->driver is not null, but driver is not bound.      __device_release_driver()        klist_remove(&dev->p->knode_driver) <-- It causes null-ptr-deref.    // normal path    bus_probe_device() // It's not called yet.      device_bind_driver()If dev->driver is set, in the error path after calling bus_add_device()in device_add(), bus_remove_device() is called, then the device will bedetached from driver. But device_bind_driver() is not called yet, so itcauses null-ptr-deref while access the 'knode_driver'. To fix this, setdev->driver to null in the error path before calling bus_remove_device().",
