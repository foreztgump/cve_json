In Cacti 1.2.24, under certain conditions, an authenticated privileged user, can use a malicious string in the SNMP options of a Device, performing command injection and obtaining remote code execution on the underlying server. The `lib/snmp.php` file has a set of functions, with similar behavior, that accept in input some variables and place them into an `exec` call without a proper escape or validation. This issue has been addressed in version 1.2.25. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "poc": {"reference": ["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/175029/Cacti-1.2.24-Command-Injection.html", "https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/security/advisories/GHSA-g6ff-58cj-x3cp"], "github": ["https://github.com/m3ssap0/cacti-rce-snmp-options-vulnerable-application", "https://github.com/nomi-sec/PoC-in-GitHub"]}}
