    ],
    "description": "A remote denial of service vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s TIPC kernel module. The while loop in tipc_link_xmit() hits an unknown state while attempting to parse SKBs, which are not in the queue. Sending two small UDP packets to a system with a UDP bearer results in the CPU utilization for the system to instantly spike to 100%, causing a denial of service condition.",
