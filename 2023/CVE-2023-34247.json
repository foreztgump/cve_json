{"id": "CVE-2023-34247", "product": "keystone", "version": "= <= 7.0.0 ", "vulnerability": ["CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')"], "description": "Keystone is a content management system for Node.JS. There is an open redirect in the `@keystone-6/auth` package versions 7.0.0 and prior, where the redirect leading `/` filter can be bypassed. Users may be redirected to domains other than the relative host, thereby it might be used by attackers to re-direct users to an unexpected location. To mitigate this issue, one may apply a patch from pull request 8626 or avoid using the `@keystone-6/auth` package.", "poc": {"reference": ["No PoCs from references."], "github": ["https://github.com/scgajge12/scgajge12.github.io"]}}
