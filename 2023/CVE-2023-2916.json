This can allow authenticated attackers with subscriber-level permissions or above to extract sensitive data including configuration. It can only be exploited if the plugin has not been configured yet. If combined with another arbitrary plugin installation and activation vulnerability, it may be possible to connect a site to InfiniteWP which would make remote management possible and allow for elevation of privileges.", "poc": {"reference": ["No PoCs from references."], "github": ["https://github.com/d0rb/CVE-2023-2916", "https://github.com/nomi-sec/PoC-in-GitHub"]}}
