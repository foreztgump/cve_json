When this check fails, libcurl would free the memory for the fingerprint before it returns an error message containing the (now freed) hash. This flaw risks inserting sensitive heap-based data into the error message that might be shown to users or otherwise get leaked and revealed.", "poc": {"reference": ["No PoCs from references."], "github": ["https://github.com/awest25/Curl-Security-Evaluation", "https://github.com/fkie-cad/nvd-json-data-feeds", "https://github.com/jp-cpe/retrieve-cvss-scores"]}}
