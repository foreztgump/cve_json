This provides a pathway for an attacker to send/receive arbitrary IPv6 packets to devices on the LAN, potentially exploiting them if they lack additional authentication or contain any network vulnerabilities that would normally be mitigated by the home router\u2019s NAT firewall. Effected devices have been mitigated through an automatic update beyond the affected range.", "poc": {"reference": ["No PoCs from references."], "github": ["https://github.com/Qorvo/QGateway"]}}
