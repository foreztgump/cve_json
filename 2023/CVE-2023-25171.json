{"id": "CVE-2023-25171", "product": "kiwi", "version": "12.0< 12.0 ", "vulnerability": ["CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling"], "description": "Kiwi TCMS, an open source test management system, does not impose rate limits in versions prior to 12.0. This makes it easier to attempt denial-of-service attacks against the Password reset page. An attacker could potentially send a large number of emails if they know the email addresses of users in Kiwi TCMS. Additionally that may strain SMTP resources. Users should upgrade to v12.0 or later to receive a patch. As potential workarounds, users may install and configure a rate-limiting proxy in front of Kiwi TCMS and/or configure rate limits on their email server when possible.", "poc": {"reference": ["https://huntr.dev/bounties/3b712cb6-3fa3-4f71-8562-7a7016c6262e"], "github": ["No PoCs found on GitHub currently."]}}
