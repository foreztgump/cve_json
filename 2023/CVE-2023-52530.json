    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:wifi: mac80211: fix potential key use-after-freeWhen ieee80211_key_link() is called by ieee80211_gtk_rekey_add()but returns 0 due to KRACK protection (identical key reinstall),ieee80211_gtk_rekey_add() will still return a pointer into thekey, in a potential use-after-free. This normally doesn't happensince it's only called by iwlwifi in case of WoWLAN rekey offloadwhich has its own KRACK protection, but still better to fix, dothat by returning an error code and converting that to success onthe cfg80211 boundary only, leaving the error for bad callers ofieee80211_gtk_rekey_add().",
