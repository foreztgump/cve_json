    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:cifs: fix mid leak during reconnection after timeout thresholdWhen the number of responses with status of STATUS_IO_TIMEOUTexceeds a specified threshold (NUM_STATUS_IO_TIMEOUT), we reconnectthe connection. But we do not return the mid, or the creditsreturned for the mid, or reduce the number of in-flight requests.This bug could result in the server->in_flight count to go bad,and also cause a leak in the mids.This change moves the check to a few lines below where theresponse is decrypted, even of the response is read from thetransform header. This way, the code for returning the midscan be reused.Also, the cifs_reconnect was reconnecting just the transportconnection before. In case of multi-channel, this may not bewhat we want to do after several timeouts. Changed that toreconnect the session and the tree too.Also renamed NUM_STATUS_IO_TIMEOUT to a more appropriate nameMAX_STATUS_IO_TIMEOUT.",
