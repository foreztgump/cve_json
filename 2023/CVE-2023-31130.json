C-ares only uses this function internally for configuration purposes which would require an administrator to configure such an address via ares_set_sortlist(). However, users may externally use ares_inet_net_pton() for other purposes and thus be vulnerable to more severe issues. This issue has been fixed in 1.19.1.", "poc": {"reference": ["No PoCs from references."], "github": ["https://github.com/fkie-cad/nvd-json-data-feeds"]}}
