    "description": "fsevents before 1.2.11 depends on the https://fsevents-binaries.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com URL, which might allow an adversary to execute arbitrary code if any JavaScript project (that depends on fsevents) distributes code that was obtained from that URL at a time when it was controlled by an adversary. NOTE: some sources feel that this means that no version is affected any longer, because the URL is not controlled by an adversary.",
