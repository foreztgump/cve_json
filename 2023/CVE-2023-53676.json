    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:scsi: target: iscsi: Fix buffer overflow in lio_target_nacl_info_show()The function lio_target_nacl_info_show() uses sprintf() in a loop to printdetails for every iSCSI connection in a session without checking for thebuffer length. With enough iSCSI connections it's possible to overflow thebuffer provided by configfs and corrupt the memory.This patch replaces sprintf() with sysfs_emit_at() that checks for bufferboundries.",
