    "id": "CVE-2023-40661",
    "product": "Fedora",
    "version": "n/a",
    "vulnerability": [
        "Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer"
    ],
    "description": "Several memory vulnerabilities were identified within the OpenSC packages, particularly in the card enrollment process using pkcs15-init when a user or administrator enrolls cards. To take advantage of these flaws, an attacker must have physical access to the computer system and employ a custom-crafted USB device or smart card to manipulate responses to APDUs. This manipulation can potentially allow \ncompromise key generation, certificate loading, and other card management operations during enrollment.",
