This sort field is sent from the front-end to the back-end, and the SQL query is generated using this field. However, because this sort field isn't validated, there is a risk of SQL injection vulnerability.\u00c2\u00a0The attacker must successfully log into the system to launch an attack, which may cause data leakage.
