        "CWE-639 Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key"
    ],
    "description": "The BadgeOS plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in versions up to, and including, 3.7.1.6. This is due to improper validation and authorization checks within the badgeos_update_steps_ajax_handler, badgeos_update_award_steps_ajax_handler, badgeos_update_deduct_steps_ajax_handler, and badgeos_update_ranks_req_steps_ajax_handler functions. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to overwrite arbitrary post titles.",
