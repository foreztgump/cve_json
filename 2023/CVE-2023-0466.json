        "improper certificate validation"
    ],
    "description": "The function X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy() is documented toimplicitly enable the certificate policy check when doing certificateverification. However the implementation of the function does notenable the check which allows certificates with invalid or incorrectpolicies to pass the certificate verification.As suddenly enabling the policy check could break existing deployments it wasdecided to keep the existing behavior of the X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy()function.Instead the applications that require OpenSSL to perform certificatepolicy check need to use X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies() or explicitlyenable the policy check by calling X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set_flags() withthe X509_V_FLAG_POLICY_CHECK flag argument.Certificate policy checks are disabled by default in OpenSSL and are notcommonly used by applications.",
