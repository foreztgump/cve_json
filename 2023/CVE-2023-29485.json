    "description": "** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in Heimdal Thor agent versions 3.4.2 and before on Windows and 2.6.9 and before on macOS, allows attackers to bypass network filtering, execute arbitrary code, and obtain sensitive information via DarkLayer Guard threat prevention module. NOTE: Heimdal disputes the validity of this issue arguing that their DNS Security for Endpoint filters DNS traffic on the endpoint by intercepting system-generated DNS requests. The product was not designed to intercept DNS requests from third-party solutions.",
