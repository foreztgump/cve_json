    "description": "The WP Directory Kit plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data and loss of data due to a missing capability check on the 'ajax_admin' function in versions up to, and including, 1.2.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber-level permissions or above to delete or change plugin settings, import demo data, delete Directory Kit related posts and terms, and install arbitrary plugins. A partial patch was introduced in version 1.2.0.",
