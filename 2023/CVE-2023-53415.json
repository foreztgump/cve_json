    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:USB: dwc3: fix memory leak with using debugfs_lookup()When calling debugfs_lookup() the result must have dput() called on it,otherwise the memory will leak over time.  To make things simpler, justcall debugfs_lookup_and_remove() instead which handles all of the logicat once.Note, the root dentry for the debugfs directory for the device needs tobe saved so we don't have to keep looking it up, which required a bitmore refactoring to properly create and remove it when needed.",
