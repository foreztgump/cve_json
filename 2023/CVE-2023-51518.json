        "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
    ],
    "description": "Apache James prior to version 3.7.5 and 3.8.0 exposes a JMX endpoint on localhost subject to pre-authentication deserialisation of untrusted data.Given a deserialisation gadjet, this could be leveraged as part of an exploit chain that could result in privilege escalation.Note that by default JMX endpoint is only bound locally.We recommend users to:\u00a0- Upgrade to a non-vulnerable Apache James version\u00a0- Run Apache James isolated from other processes (docker - dedicated virtual machine)\u00a0- If possible turn off JMX",
