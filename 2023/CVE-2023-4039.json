    "id": "CVE-2023-4039",
    "product": "Arm GNU Toolchain",
    "version": "= All versions of GCC that target AArch64 when option -fstack-protector is used ",
    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-693 Protection Mechanism Failure"
    ],
    "description": "** DISPUTED ** **DISPUTED**A failure in the -fstack-protector feature in GCC-based toolchains that target AArch64 allows an attacker to exploit an existing buffer overflow in dynamically-sized local variables in your application without this being detected. This stack-protector failure only applies to C99-style dynamically-sized local variables or those created using alloca(). The stack-protector operates as intended for statically-sized local variables.The default behavior when the stack-protector detects an overflow is to terminate your application, resulting in controlled loss of availability. An attacker who can exploit a buffer overflow without triggering the stack-protector might be able to change program flow control to cause an uncontrolled loss of availability or to go further and affect confidentiality or integrity. NOTE: The GCC project argues that this is a missed hardening bug and not a vulnerability by itself.",
