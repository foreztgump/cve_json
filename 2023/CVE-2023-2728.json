The policy ensures pods running with a service account may only reference secrets specified in the service account\u2019s secrets field. Kubernetes clusters are only affected if the ServiceAccount admission plugin and the `kubernetes.io/enforce-mountable-secrets` annotation are used together with ephemeral containers.", "poc": {"reference": ["No PoCs from references."], "github": ["https://github.com/noirfate/k8s_debug"]}}
