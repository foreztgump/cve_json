        "CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
    ],
    "description": "The ownCloud Android app allows ownCloud users to access, share, and edit files and folders. Prior to version 3.0, the app has an incomplete fix for a path traversal issue and is vulnerable to two bypass methods. The bypasses may lead to information disclosure when uploading the app\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s internal files, and to arbitrary file write when uploading plain text files (although limited by the .txt extension). Version 3.0 fixes the reported bypasses.",
