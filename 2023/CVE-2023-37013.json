    "description": "Open5GS MME versions <= 2.6.4 contains an assertion that can be remotely triggered via a sufficiently large ASN.1 packet over the S1AP interface. An attacker may repeatedly send such an oversized packet to cause the `ogs_sctp_recvmsg` routine to reach an unexpected network state and crash, leading to denial of service.",
