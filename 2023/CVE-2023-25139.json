{"id": "CVE-2023-25139", "product": "n/a", "version": "n/a", "vulnerability": ["n/a"], "description": "sprintf in the GNU C Library (glibc) 2.37 has a buffer overflow (out-of-bounds write) in some situations with a correct buffer size. This is unrelated to CWE-676. It may write beyond the bounds of the destination buffer when attempting to write a padded, thousands-separated string representation of a number, if the buffer is allocated the exact size required to represent that number as a string. For example, 1,234,567 (with padding to 13) overflows by two bytes.", "poc": {"reference": ["No PoCs from references."], "github": ["https://github.com/ARPSyndicate/cvemon", "https://github.com/ortelius/ms-compitem-crud", "https://github.com/ortelius/ms-dep-pkg-cud", "https://github.com/ortelius/ms-dep-pkg-r", "https://github.com/ortelius/ms-sbom-export", "https://github.com/ortelius/ms-scorecard", "https://github.com/ortelius/ms-textfile-crud"]}}
