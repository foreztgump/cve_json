The injected commands are executed via the exec() function in the execQuoted() method of the ilUtil class (/Services/Utilities/classes/class.ilUtil.php) This allows attackers to inject malicious commands into the system, potentially compromising the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of the ILIAS installation and the underlying operating system.", "poc": {"reference": ["https://rehmeinfosec.de/labor/cve-2023-45869"], "github": ["No PoCs found on GitHub currently."]}}
