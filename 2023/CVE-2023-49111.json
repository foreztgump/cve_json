        "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (XSS or 'Cross-site Scripting')"
    ],
    "description": "For Kiuwan installations with SSO (single sign-on) enabled, an unauthenticated reflected cross-site scripting attack can be performed on the login page \"login.html\". This is possible due to the request parameter \"message\" values being directly included in a JavaScript block in the response. This is especially critical in business environments using AD SSO authentication, e.g. via ADFS, where attackers could potentially steal AD passwords.This issue affects Kiuwan SAST: <master.1808.p685.q13371",
