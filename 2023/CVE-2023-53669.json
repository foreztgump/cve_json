    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:tcp: fix skb_copy_ubufs() vs BIG TCPDavid Ahern reported crashes in skb_copy_ubufs() caused by TCP tx zerocopyusing hugepages, and skb length bigger than ~68 KB.skb_copy_ubufs() assumed it could copy all payload using up toMAX_SKB_FRAGS order-0 pages.This assumption broke when BIG TCP was able to put up to 512 KB per skb.We did not hit this bug at Google because we use CONFIG_MAX_SKB_FRAGS=45and limit gso_max_size to 180000.A solution is to use higher order pages if needed.v2: add missing __GFP_COMP, or we leak memory.",
