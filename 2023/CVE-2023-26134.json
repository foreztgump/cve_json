    "vulnerability": [
        "Command Injection"
    ],
    "description": "Versions of the package git-commit-info before 2.0.2 are vulnerable to Command Injection such that the package-exported method gitCommitInfo () fails to sanitize its parameter commit, which later flows into a sensitive command execution API. As a result, attackers may inject malicious commands once they control the hash content.",
