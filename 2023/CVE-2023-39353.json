{"id": "CVE-2023-39353", "product": "FreeRDP", "version": "= < 2.11.0 ", "vulnerability": ["CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read"], "description": "FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), released under the Apache license. Affected versions are subject to a missing offset validation leading to Out Of Bound Read. In the `libfreerdp/codec/rfx.c` file there is no offset validation in `tile->quantIdxY`, `tile->quantIdxCb`, and `tile->quantIdxCr`. As a result crafted input can lead to an out of bounds read access which in turn will cause a crash. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.11.0 and 3.0.0-beta3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "poc": {"reference": ["https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/security/advisories/GHSA-hg53-9j9h-3c8f"], "github": ["No PoCs found on GitHub currently."]}}
