    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:cacheinfo: Fix shared_cpu_map to handle shared caches at different levelsThe cacheinfo sets up the shared_cpu_map by checking whether the cacheswith the same index are shared between CPUs. However, this will triggerslab-out-of-bounds access if the CPUs do not have the same cache hierarchy.Another problem is the mismatched shared_cpu_map when the shared cache doesnot have the same index between CPUs.CPU0\tI\tD\tL3index\t0\t1\t2\tx\t^\t^\t^\t^index\t0\t1\t2\t3CPU1\tI\tD\tL2\tL3This patch checks each cache is shared with all caches on other CPUs.",
