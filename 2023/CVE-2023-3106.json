This issue can occur when the Netlink socket receives the message(sendmsg) for the XFRM_MSG_GETSA, XFRM_MSG_GETPOLICY type message, and the DUMP flag is set and can cause a denial of service or possibly another unspecified impact. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out, although it is unlikely.", "poc": {"reference": ["No PoCs from references."], "github": ["https://github.com/fkie-cad/nvd-json-data-feeds", "https://github.com/nidhi7598/linux-4.1.15_CVE-2023-3106"]}}
