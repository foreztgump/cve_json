    ],
    "description": "There is insufficient sanitization of tainted file names that are directly concatenated with a path that is subsequently passed to a \u2018require_once\u2019 statement. This allows arbitrary files with the \u2018.php\u2019 extension for which the absolute path is known to be included and executed. There are no known means in PHPFusion through which an attacker can upload and target a \u2018.php\u2019 file payload.",
