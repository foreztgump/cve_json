These enrolment tokens could allow someone to enrol an agent into an agent policy, and potentially use that to retrieve other secrets in the policy including for Elasticsearch and third-party services. Alternatively a threat actor could potentially enrol agents to the clusters and send arbitrary events to Elasticsearch.", "poc": {"reference": ["https://www.elastic.co/community/security"], "github": ["No PoCs found on GitHub currently."]}}
