    "version": "Fixed in kernel 5.18-rc5 ",
    "vulnerability": [
        "CWE-416"
    ],
    "description": "A flaw was found in the MCTP protocol in the Linux kernel. The function mctp_unregister() reclaims the device's relevant resource when a netcard detaches. However, a running routine may be unaware of this and cause the use-after-free of the mdev->addrs object, potentially leading to a denial of service.",
