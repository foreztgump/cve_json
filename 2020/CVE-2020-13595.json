{"id": "CVE-2020-13595", "product": "n/a", "version": "n/a", "vulnerability": ["n/a"], "description": "The Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) controller implementation in Espressif ESP-IDF 4.0 through 4.2 (for ESP32 devices) returns the wrong number of completed BLE packets and triggers a reachable assertion on the host stack when receiving a packet with an MIC failure. An attacker within radio range can silently trigger the assertion (which disables the target's BLE stack) by sending a crafted sequence of BLE packets.", "poc": {"reference": ["No PoCs from references."], "github": ["https://github.com/JeffroMF/awesome-bluetooth-security321", "https://github.com/Matheus-Garbelini/sweyntooth_bluetooth_low_energy_attacks", "https://github.com/engn33r/awesome-bluetooth-security"]}}
