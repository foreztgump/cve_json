{"id": "CVE-2020-36317", "product": "n/a", "version": "n/a", "vulnerability": ["n/a"], "description": "In the standard library in Rust before 1.49.0, String::retain() function has a panic safety problem. It allows creation of a non-UTF-8 Rust string when the provided closure panics. This bug could result in a memory safety violation when other string APIs assume that UTF-8 encoding is used on the same string.", "poc": {"reference": ["No PoCs from references."], "github": ["https://github.com/Qwaz/rust-cve", "https://github.com/sslab-gatech/Rudra-Artifacts"]}}
