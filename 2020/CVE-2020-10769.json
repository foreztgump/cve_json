When a payload longer than 4 bytes, and is not following 4-byte alignment boundary guidelines, it causes a buffer over-read threat, leading to a system crash. This flaw allows a local attacker with user privileges to cause a denial of service.", "poc": {"reference": ["https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuApr2021.html"], "github": ["https://github.com/ARPSyndicate/cvemon"]}}
