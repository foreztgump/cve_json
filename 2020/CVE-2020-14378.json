        "CWE-191 leads to CWE-400"
    ],
    "description": "An integer underflow in dpdk versions before 18.11.10 and before 19.11.5 in the `move_desc` function can lead to large amounts of CPU cycles being eaten up in a long running loop. An attacker could cause `move_desc` to get stuck in a 4,294,967,295-count iteration loop. Depending on how `vhost_crypto` is being used this could prevent other VMs or network tasks from being serviced by the busy DPDK lcore for an extended period.",
