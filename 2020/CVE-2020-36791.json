    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net_sched: keep alloc_hash updated after hash allocationIn commit 599be01ee567 (\"net_sched: fix an OOB access in cls_tcindex\")I moved cp->hash calculation before the firsttcindex_alloc_perfect_hash(), but cp->alloc_hash is left untouched.This difference could lead to another out of bound access.cp->alloc_hash should always be the size allocated, we shouldupdate it after this tcindex_alloc_perfect_hash().",
