    "product": "Windows 10 Version 1507",
    "version": "10.0.0 ",
    "vulnerability": [
        "Elevation of Privilege"
    ],
    "description": "<p>A local elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in how splwow64.exe handles certain calls. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could elevate privileges on an affected system from low-integrity to medium-integrity.</p><p>This vulnerability by itself does not allow arbitrary code execution; however, it could allow arbitrary code to be run if the attacker uses it in combination with another vulnerability (such as a remote code execution vulnerability or another elevation of privilege vulnerability) that is capable of leveraging the elevated privileges when code execution is attempted.</p><p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by ensuring splwow64.exe properly handles these calls..</p>",
