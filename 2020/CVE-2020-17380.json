{"id": "CVE-2020-17380", "product": "n/a", "version": "n/a", "vulnerability": ["n/a"], "description": "A heap-based buffer overflow was found in QEMU through 5.0.0 in the SDHCI device emulation support. It could occur while doing a multi block SDMA transfer via the sdhci_sdma_transfer_multi_blocks() routine in hw/sd/sdhci.c. A guest user or process could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service condition, or potentially execute arbitrary code with privileges of the QEMU process on the host.", "poc": {"reference": ["No PoCs from references."], "github": ["https://github.com/Live-Hack-CVE/CVE-2020-17380"]}}
