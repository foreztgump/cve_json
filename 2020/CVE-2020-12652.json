NOTE: the vendor states \"The security impact of this bug is not as bad as it could have been because these operations are all privileged and root already has enormous destructive power.\"", "poc": {"reference": ["https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v5.x/ChangeLog-5.4.14"], "github": ["https://github.com/ARPSyndicate/cvemon"]}}
