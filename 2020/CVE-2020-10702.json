    ],
    "description": "A flaw was found in QEMU in the implementation of the Pointer Authentication (PAuth) support for ARM introduced in version 4.0 and fixed in version 5.0.0. A general failure of the signature generation process caused every PAuth-enforced pointer to be signed with the same signature. A local attacker could obtain the signature of a protected pointer and abuse this flaw to bypass PAuth protection for all programs running on QEMU.",
