    "description": "BACnet Test Server versions up to and including 1.01 contains a remote denial of service vulnerability in its BACnet/IP BVLC packet handling. The server fails to properly validate the BVLC Length field in incoming UDP BVLC frames on the default BACnet port (47808/udp). A remote unauthenticated attacker can send a malformed BVLC Length value to trigger an access violation and crash the application, resulting in a denial of service.",
