        "CWE-379 Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Incorrect Permissions",
        "insecure temporary file vulnerability"
    ],
    "description": "As mitigation for CVE-2020-1945 Apache Ant 1.10.8 changed the permissions of temporary files it created so that only the current user was allowed to access them. Unfortunately the fixcrlf task deleted the temporary file and created a new one without said protection, effectively nullifying the effort. This would still allow an attacker to inject modified source files into the build process.",
