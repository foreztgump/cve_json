{"id": "CVE-2020-10781", "product": "kernel", "version": "n/a", "vulnerability": ["CWE-732"], "description": "A flaw was found in the Linux Kernel before 5.8-rc6 in the ZRAM kernel module, where a user with a local account and the ability to read the /sys/class/zram-control/hot_add file can create ZRAM device nodes in the /dev/ directory. This read allocates kernel memory and is not accounted for a user that triggers the creation of that ZRAM device. With this vulnerability, continually reading the device may consume a large amount of system memory and cause the Out-of-Memory (OOM) killer to activate and terminate random userspace processes, possibly making the system inoperable.", "poc": {"reference": ["https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=853eab68afc80f59f36bbdeb715e5c88c501e680"], "github": ["https://github.com/ARPSyndicate/cvemon", "https://github.com/Live-Hack-CVE/CVE-2020-10781", "https://github.com/evdenis/cvehound"]}}
