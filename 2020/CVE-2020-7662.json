{"id": "CVE-2020-7662", "product": "websocket-extensions (npm)", "version": "n/a", "vulnerability": ["Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)"], "description": "websocket-extensions npm module prior to 0.1.4 allows Denial of Service (DoS) via Regex Backtracking. The extension parser may take quadratic time when parsing a header containing an unclosed string parameter value whose content is a repeating two-byte sequence of a backslash and some other character. This could be abused by an attacker to conduct Regex Denial Of Service (ReDoS) on a single-threaded server by providing a malicious payload with the Sec-WebSocket-Extensions header.", "poc": {"reference": ["https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-WEBSOCKETEXTENSIONS-570623"], "github": ["https://github.com/PalindromeLabs/awesome-websocket-security", "https://github.com/engn33r/awesome-redos-security", "https://github.com/ossf-cve-benchmark/CVE-2020-7662"]}}
