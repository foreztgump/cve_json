    "id": "CVE-2020-12402",
    "product": "Firefox",
    "version": "< 78 ",
    "vulnerability": [
        "RSA Key Generation vulnerable to side-channel attack"
    ],
    "description": "During RSA key generation, bignum implementations used a variation of the Binary Extended Euclidean Algorithm which entailed significantly input-dependent flow. This allowed an attacker able to perform electromagnetic-based side channel attacks to record traces leading to the recovery of the secret primes. *Note:* An unmodified Firefox browser does not generate RSA keys in normal operation and is not affected, but products built on top of it might. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 78.",
