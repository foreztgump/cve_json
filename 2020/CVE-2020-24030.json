    "description": "ForLogic Qualiex v1 and v3 has weak token expiration. This allows remote unauthenticated privilege escalation and access to sensitive data via token reuse. NOTE: as of 2025-10-14, the Supplier's perspective is that this is \"not exploitable in the current implementation. Tokens are properly expired, invalidated, and bound to session context. Attempts to alter the token payload to extend its validity do not affect server-side validation.\"",
