NOTE: the vendor disputes this because these two conditions for PHP object injection are not satisfied: existence of a PHP magic method (such as __wakeup or __destruct), and any attack-relevant classes must be declared before unserialize is called (or must be autoloaded). .", "poc": {"reference": ["No PoCs from references."], "github": ["https://github.com/hannob/squirrelpatches"]}}
