    "id": "CVE-2020-11986",
    "product": "Apache NetBeans",
    "version": "n/a",
    "vulnerability": [
        "Code execution without user consent"
    ],
    "description": "To be able to analyze gradle projects, the build scripts need to be executed. Apache NetBeans follows this pattern. This causes the code of the build script to be invoked at load time of the project. Apache NetBeans up to and including 12.0 did not request consent from the user for the analysis of the project at load time. This in turn will run potentially malicious code, from an external source, without the consent of the user.",
