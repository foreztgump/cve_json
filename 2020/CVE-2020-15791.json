SIPLUS variants) (All versions), SIMATIC WinAC RTX (F) 2010 (All versions), SINUMERIK 840D sl (All versions). The authentication protocol between a client and a PLC via port 102/tcp (ISO-TSAP) insufficiently protects the transmitted password. This could allow an attacker that is able to intercept the network traffic to obtain valid PLC credentials.", "poc": {"reference": ["No PoCs from references."], "github": ["https://github.com/404notf0und/CVE-Flow", "https://github.com/ARPSyndicate/cvemon", "https://github.com/vishaalmehta1/AdeenAyub"]}}
