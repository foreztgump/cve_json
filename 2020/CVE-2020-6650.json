    "description": "UPS companion software v1.05 & Prior is affected by \u2018Eval Injection\u2019 vulnerability. The software does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before using the input in a dynamic evaluation call e.g.\u201deval\u201d in \u201cUpdate Manager\u201d class when software attempts to see if there are updates available. This results in arbitrary code execution on the machine where software is installed.",
