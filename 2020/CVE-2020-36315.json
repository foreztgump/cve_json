{"id": "CVE-2020-36315", "product": "n/a", "version": "n/a", "vulnerability": ["n/a"], "description": "In RELIC before 2020-08-01, RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signature forgery can occur because certain checks of the padding (and of the first two bytes) are inadequate. NOTE: this requires that a low public exponent (such as 3) is being used. The product, by default, does not generate RSA keys with such a low number.", "poc": {"reference": ["https://github.com/relic-toolkit/relic/", "https://github.com/relic-toolkit/relic/issues/154"], "github": ["No PoCs found on GitHub currently."]}}
