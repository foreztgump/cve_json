{"id": "CVE-2020-35488", "product": "n/a", "version": "n/a", "vulnerability": ["n/a"], "description": "The fileop module of the NXLog service in NXLog Community Edition 2.10.2150 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via a crafted Syslog payload to the Syslog service. This attack requires a specific configuration. Also, the name of the directory created must use a Syslog field. (For example, on Linux it is not possible to create a .. directory. On Windows, it is not possible to create a CON directory.)", "poc": {"reference": ["https://github.com/GuillaumePetit84/CVE-2020-35488"], "github": ["https://github.com/ARPSyndicate/cvemon", "https://github.com/GuillaumePetit84/CVE-2020-35488", "https://github.com/developer3000S/PoC-in-GitHub", "https://github.com/githubfoam/nxlog-ubuntu-githubactions", "https://github.com/hectorgie/PoC-in-GitHub", "https://github.com/nomi-sec/PoC-in-GitHub"]}}
