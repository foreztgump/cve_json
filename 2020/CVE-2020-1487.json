    "description": "An information disclosure vulnerability exists when Media Foundation improperly handles objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could obtain information to further compromise the user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s system.To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to log onto an affected system and open a specially crafted file. In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website (or leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided content) that contains a specially crafted file that is designed to exploit the vulnerability. However, an attacker would have no way to force the user to visit the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince the user to click a link, typically by way of an enticement in an email or Instant Messenger message, and then convince the user to open the specially crafted file.The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Media Foundation handles objects in memory.",
