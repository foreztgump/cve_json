The attacker is restricted as they are unable to download non-quarantined files or supply command line arguments to the application, limiting the impact. Note: this issue only occurs on Mac OSX. Other operating systems are unaffected. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 68.5, Firefox < 73, and Firefox < ESR68.5.", "poc": {"reference": ["https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1596668"], "github": ["https://github.com/ARPSyndicate/cvemon"]}}
