    ],
    "description": "The WP ERP | Complete HR solution with recruitment & job listings | WooCommerce CRM & Accounting plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.6.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the handle_leave_calendar_filter, add_enable_disable_option_save, leave_policies, process_bulk_action, and process_crm_contact functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugins settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
