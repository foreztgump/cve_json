    "vulnerability": [
        "Elevation of Privilege"
    ],
    "description": "<p>An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the Windows Installer when the Windows Installer fails to properly sanitize input leading to an insecure library loading behavior.</p><p>A locally authenticated attacker could run arbitrary code with elevated system privileges. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p><p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the input sanitization error to preclude unintended elevation.</p>",
