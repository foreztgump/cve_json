{"id": "CVE-2020-10717", "product": "QEMU", "version": "n/a", "vulnerability": ["CWE-770"], "description": "A potential DoS flaw was found in the virtio-fs shared file system daemon (virtiofsd) implementation of the QEMU version >= v5.0. Virtio-fs is meant to share a host file system directory with a guest via virtio-fs device. If the guest opens the maximum number of file descriptors under the shared directory, a denial of service may occur. This flaw allows a guest user/process to cause this denial of service on the host.", "poc": {"reference": ["No PoCs from references."], "github": ["https://github.com/Live-Hack-CVE/CVE-2020-10717"]}}
