NOTE: this candidate may change significantly as the security community discusses the technical nature of NAPTHA and learns more about the affected applications. This candidate is at a higher level of abstraction than is typical for CVE.", "poc": {"reference": ["No PoCs from references."], "github": ["https://github.com/Eplox/TCP-Starvation"]}}
