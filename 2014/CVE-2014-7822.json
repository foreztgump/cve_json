    "description": "The implementation of certain splice_write file operations in the Linux kernel before 3.16 does not enforce a restriction on the maximum size of a single file, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted splice system call, as demonstrated by use of a file descriptor associated with an ext4 filesystem.",
