    "description": "The login form in Bugzilla 2.x, 3.x, 4.x before 4.4.3, and 4.5.x before 4.5.3 does not properly handle a correctly authenticated but unintended login attempt, which makes it easier for remote authenticated users to obtain sensitive information by arranging for a victim to login to the attacker's account and then submit a vulnerability report, related to a \"login CSRF\" issue.",
