    ],
    "description": "Array Networks vAPV (version 8.3.2.17) and vxAG (version 9.2.0.34) appliances are affected by a privilege escalation vulnerability caused by a combination of hardcoded SSH credentials (or SSH private key) and insecure permissions on a startup script. The devices ship with a default SSH login\u00c2\u00a0or a hardcoded DSA private key, allowing an attacker to authenticate remotely with limited privileges.Once authenticated, an attacker can overwrite the world-writable /ca/bin/monitor.sh script with arbitrary commands. Since this script is executed with elevated privileges through the backend binary, enabling the debug monitor via backend -c \"debug monitor on\" triggers execution of the attacker's payload as root. This allows full system compromise.",
